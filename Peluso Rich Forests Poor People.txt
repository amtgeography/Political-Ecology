State controlled forest programs have often failed to achieve either environmental or economic goals, in part due to local resistance

Often these programs actually make degradation worse by damaging livelihoods of marginal people who intensify forest use to cope

'Scientific' forestry purports to be value-neutral, but generally assumes right of state to direct forest use, marginalizes local needs

Export of scientific forestry from Europe has typically failed to consider local contexts of history, culture, society, and so on

European model of state control imported via colonialism criminalizes local, traditional forest use necessary for people's livelihoods

Resistance is endemic to this model because of the endangered livelihoods, often leading to forest degradation and social unrest

Coercion is tied to attempts by different groups to control resources and access to resources, and in Indonesia involved mass repression

Peasants possess their own, locally defined notions of concepts like morality and rights as well as criminal or subversive acts

Peasants have responded to loss of resources by unity in culture of resistance and differentiation in competition for resources or work

Class divisions within peasant society further complicate landscape fo resistance via shifting alliances and resource grabs by powerful

Newly freed colonial powers have often become more repressive than under colonial control as local elites emulate European systems

In Java, Indonesian authorities work to enforce state law and power in forests which state claims control over, face resistance

Teak is economically valuable, in timber form to state and to local building needs, leaves of young trees for local trade networks

Dutch, later English, colonial authorities sought to control Teak and expand plantations for export to meet European needs

Japanese invasion led to creation of agricultural villages in forests, seizure of products of forests and villages, land destruction

State inheritors of system have continued control attempts, contributing to civil war between communists, islamists, and government 

Mass violence marred landscape and saw forests as sites of battle due to cover and provision of supplies to combatants

In recent years, conflict has continued between foresters and their guards and villagers, who cooperate or resist in different measures

Guards find themselves between the moral economy of locals and ties to state/scientific forestry, must toe a narrow line

Corruption is common, both because of forester need for additional income as well as to avoid violent confrontation with locals

State forestry continues to claim a desire for local involvement in management, but does not make good on most promises, leading to mistrust

At core of problem is unsolved need for locals to obtain means of subsistence as traditionally provided by local forests

State prevention of this subsistence activity is intimately tied to conflict, which has proven intractable in long term

Deforestation occurs despite regulations, exacerbated by black markets and peasant incentives to steal timber
