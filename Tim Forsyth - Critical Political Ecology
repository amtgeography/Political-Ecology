*Overall, another summary of Political Ecology, its history, so forth. Good general PE citation. More critical than Robbins piece, bit more advanced. Good discussion of the philosophy of science!

Critical PE is needed to get past issue of paying too much attention to either 'science' or post modernism
Environmental probs exist, but are not down to simple causes, have to be critical of purported connections
IPAT problematic as the foundations it grew from, malthus thinking in particular

***its really a formative work. Stuff you already know from elsewhere. Cite with Robbins, Blaikie
