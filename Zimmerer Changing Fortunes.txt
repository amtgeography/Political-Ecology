Crop diversity in Peru has been affected by changes in the distribution of wealth in local society as well as by exposure to markets

Spanish colonization did not actually cause a genetic crisis, wealthier peasants have preserved diversity alongside new cultivars

Peasants in Peru notably sought a localized conception of a 'fit livelihood' tied to dietary diversity and ability to obtain it

The causes of genetic loss in agricultural landscapes are complex, not easily summarized under banners of globalization or overpopulation

Modern high-yield crops are not completely displacing native varieties in farms in rural Peru, crop variety choice is not simple

Peru is a unique case due to the numerous climates in small areas caused by the mountainous rise of the Andes

Crop type is physically tied to elevation band and soil quality, and diverse types are planted in bands suited to local conditions

Numerous sub-types of common plants are to be found, chosen according to characteristics, potatoes being quite diverse

Nature and society are linked in a dynamic, fluid relationship of interdependence, fusion of physical and human geography necessary

Assumptions of plants being perfectly suited to local environments are not always well founded, adaptation is imperfect

Peasants in Peru traditionally valued diversity in diets which led to crop diversity, social values thus tied to physical attributes

Land use is not necessarily adapted to ecology of crops and animals, in Peru land use is tied to control of land so has social component

Only at a large scale is agriculture terraced in a predictable, altitude-controlled set of bands, much more diversity locally

Cultures do adapt to landscape, but their choices do not reflect perfect adaptation, historical contingencies must be considered

Inca empire caused disruption to original traditional activities, seizing labor and products of agriculture, mandating certain crops

Spanish conquest further disrupted the social and cultural connections to landscape, prioritizing different relationship to crops

In Peru, it is middle-class peasants who have most abandoned diversity, while the rich maintain it in part as tie to conception of old ways

Crop selection is tied both to land suitability and to cultural preferences, even aesthetic preferences, in turn influenced by globalization

Thus, landscapes and in particular diversity in crops are inherently linked to social and cultural processes, particularly wealth
