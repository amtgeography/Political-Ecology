Watts:


The initial strength of Blaikie's work was to bring together cultural ecology and ecological anthropology to create a new synthesis

This helped to ally geographers, foresters, and anthropologists under a common ecological framework that considered political economy

Peasant science, rent seeking behavior, reproduction squeeze all contributed to Blaikie's new synthesis, ejected standing colonial models

The weakness of Blaikie's works is in the cursory treatment of politics, property rights, and so forth

Day to day political struggle is lacking in Soil Erosion and Land Degradation is similarly afflicted



Middleton:



As a physical geographer, the emphasis on uniting social and physical is heartening, and Blaikie's work is clearly foundational in PE

Over-reliance on physical explanations in isolation give way in Blaikie's work to a more holistic approach, accepting politics & economics

Local management, the perspective of land managers, rediscovery of traditional methodologies, and the like are valuable



Blaikie:



Given a greater background in political science, Land Erosion would have had more sophisticated social and political theory in it

The use of structural marxism as a theoretical paradigm limits the capability of a work to discuss everyday politics

Lack of closer examination of resource user decision making is additional weakness, assumptions of maximization strategies implicit, sadly

Postmodernism has strongly affected Geography in the US, undermining scientific claims, but also adding nuance back into analysis

Neoliberalism is also strongly affecting Geography, obscuring links between structural global inequality and local environmental degradation







Blaikie, Piers, Cameron, John, Seddon, David. 2002. Understanding 20 Years of Change in West-Central Nepal: Continuity and Change in Lives and Ideas. World Development 30(7):1255-1270



Two studies conducted twenty years apart allows a unique examination of the success or failure of theoretical predictions for rural Nepal

Nepal's underdevelopment and stagnation was seen as due to a weak state, lack of middle class, foreign aid, trade with India, poor roads

Conducting a study after such gap is problematic, old theories may not be relevant, current local conditions can dramatically change

Earlier study relied on Marxist thinking, which largely fell out of favor in intervening time in era of market triumphalism

Many of the predictions held true, but not necessarily for the right reasons, and today's analysis may find very different mechanisms

Lack of capitalism or the continued weakness of the state could both explain results rather than structural Marxism

Original and follow-up study stratified based on mode of production - laborer, peasant, etc, and income, broken into ranges + inflat. mod.

'74-'75 distribution was largely skewed towards poor and laborer/labor + subsistence ag, but stil large self-sufficient peasant population

Predictions were primarily of continued poverty and crisis as population grew, little scope for accumulation or capitalist change

'97-'98 distribution was actually more standard, movement towards self-sufficiency plus external sales and away from laborer status

Original predictions of little capitalist accumulation proved true, but crisis did not, and greater homogeneity appears to have occurred

A key reason may be the importance of labor movement and remittances, with laborers mobile and sending home money, subsidizing incomes







Blaikie, Piers, and Muldavin, Joshua. 2004. Upstream, Downstream, China, India: The Politics of Environment in the Himalayan Region. Annals of the Association of American Geographers 94(3):520-548



A longstanding and politically powerful discourse regarding environmental degradation in the Himalayas is THED: Theory of Himal. Env. Crisis

This is largely a PPR argument, claiming population increase and inefficient agriculture has led to increased cultivation and pasturing

These in turn have led to forest clearance, overgrazed pastures, which have accelerated erosion and river sedimentation, increased floods

Rivers with origin in Himalayas such as Ganges, Yangtze, and Mekong all affected, a sense of crisis is inherent in THED discourse

Scientific roots for THED, but social explanations rely on neo-malthusianism, rural people backwardness, and inefficiency in ag sectors

Emerging research has recognized that human direct impacts have been overplayed, largely embraced at the international level

Himalayas have a naturally high rate of erosion as a result of orogenic uplift and massive collapse events, responsible for downstream effect

Many of the deconstructions of THED have focused heavily on the epistemic side of science, questioning authoritative views of science

But these deconstructions themselves tend to be inconsistently applied, accepting positivism when it agrees with their view

Effect of THED's deconstruction has been a more sophisticated view of systems of policy making, no longer rational but discursive

Policy responses under new paradigm might have: reduced watershed emphasis, less coercive land restrictions, moved from upstream focus

But neither China nor India embraced these effects, rather they have continued to emphasize the THED narrative in policymaking

Policy remains a realm of discursive alliances (a la Hajer 2005) that are shifting, embracing different truths and narratives

India's embrace of THED comes alongside backdrop of contentions interaction between local and centralized control over resources

Forest controls create conflict between subsistence users and state authorities, contributed even to formation of new state governments

Scientific management is deployed by the state to support revenue generation, often embracing language of watershed management

China's huge civil service has found similar benefits in the THED narrative due to its need to control local land use for benefit of state

China's historic trend in land control has been to colonize with dominant Han ethnic group post army conquest

This movement of people alters landscapes where the people left and where they re-settled, the latter typically in lowlands

Central bureaucracy enacts laws and regulations that address allowed land uses, constraining locals via policy

Chinese narratives tend to emphasize the oneness of all Chinese, exhorting masses to support collective goals, as defined by state

China also uses lowland victim narratives to promote control of uplands, mandating reforestation and reduction in agriculture

Need of locals to meet subsistence needs has led to increased degradation where restrictions put in place

In both China and India scientific 'truths' were embraced to serve power narratives, other 'truths' ignored, though specifics differed







Blaikie, Piers. 2006. Is Small Really Beautiful? Community-based Natural Resource Management in Malawi and Botswana. World Development 34(11): 1942-1957



Community Based Natural Resource Management (CBNRM) has been promoted as a policy goal even in places like Africa

Common pool resources are typically identified as targets for CBNRM, and the method has a long history in discourse and practice

Rural development and sustainability have to a large extent come to unversally embrace CBNRM as an objective of policy

Part of the explanation for the concept's success is use of word community, with its generally positive connotations, though may be a myth

Also plays well with a conception of 'gemeinschaft', which brings in ideas of intimacy, close living, synergy with management

Typically this leads to a supposition that local is in harmony with environment, so local is best site for management

CBNRM tends to assume that disproportionate concentrations of power between local and central are mitigated via inclusion,local participation

It also tends to be deployed as a management technique, tying local capability to manage local resources with goals set from above

CBNRM is argued to be pro-poor/provide safety net, efficient in resource use/allocation, internalizes externalities

CBNRM is also argued to mitigate open access problems, reduce external power, initiate benign participation, and mitigage state failures

For all the purported benefits, CBNRM rarely is observed to produce such benefits, usually employed in rhetoric but not practice

Some successes have been observed (CAMPFIRE) but in Africa it tends to be a simple management technique that doesn't change material needs

CBNRM has been applied to places where there was already local management embedded in local social systems, especially rangelands

It was deployed even as proponents said locals had degraded their land, and institutional perspectives have argued for necessary prereqs

CBNRM success does not depend on institutional checklists of attributes, but political interfaces and expectations of managers on locals

In effect, CBNRM theory is not flawed, its implementation is, and the process of use/discourse surrounding it is of key importance

All too often it is simply an imposition of powerful on locals dressed up as 'collaboration', 'local' is externally defined/controlled 







Blaikie, Piers. 2008. Epilogue: Towards a future for political ecology that works. Geoforum 39:765-772



PE has broad roots, and foundational ideas came from a variety of sources that did not specifically use term 'political ecology'

The breadth in inception has led to breadth in practice, and the field is often considered to be almost too broad to be meaningful

PE itself strongly benefited from the 'discursive turn' in geography in the 1990s, though its roots were more from the 80s

A difficulty in PE has been coming up with narratives with the clarity and power of Ehrlich/Population Bomb or Hardin/Tragedy of Commons

PE is no less affected than other fields than incentives in academia which are against policy relevance, long term localized studies

Engaged PE is a disuputed area, as engagement has political components, which in the past have been deployed in questionable ethical ways

Both the institutional setting where PE is studied as well as northern perspectives are important foci for future PE work







Blaikie, Piers 2011. Should some political ecology be useful? The Inaugural Lecture for the Cultural and Political Ecology Specialty Group, Annual Meeting of the Association of American Geographers, April 2010. Geoforum 43 (231-239)



PE should be linked in its production, ethics, communication, and results to a cycle of research, critique, dialogue including non-academics

Ethics and applied factors have been close to PE from the start, as has the concept of environmental justice

But environmental justice as an ethical stance needs to include actual prescriptions for how to achieve it

Post-modernism has had many benefits in uncovering power via discourse control, in questions assumptions

But it is also a lure towards speaking solely to other academics using obscure arcane language and no focus on actually doing anything

Critical realism needs to be intelligently brought back to the fore, accepting social construction but not submitting to it

Key because: rhetoric slides to relativism, discourse exam undermined human agency, science is necessary, and resistance is not only path

Critical realism needs to be embraced pragmatically, not in absolute sense, to allow PE to have an external effect

PE faces a challenge because many of its conclusions inevitably run up against established power structures, yet stand-offs are costly

There do need to be objective measures that PE can aid in actually measuring in order to 'talk truth to power'

PE practitioners ought to focus on developing a fairly standard set of professional practices in research to aid in usefulness

PE practitioners must also simultaneously recognize the danger of co-option, of bad funders, while realizing this is not inherently dire







Bryant, Raymond L., Paniagua, Angel, Kizos, Thanasis. 2011. Conceptualizing 'shadow landscape' in political ecology and rural studies. land Use Policy 28: 460-471



Trends in rural population and the marginalization of rural culture are complex, have not been adequately explained by theory

Depopulation occurs due to marginality/peripherality, scale and associated politics, domesticated landscapes, cultures of dependency

Rural landscapes are commonly perceived as an 'other', summarized in ways that do not capture their entirety, leading to 'shadow landscapes'

Shadow landscapes are present in PE particularly via the marginalization narrative and the depopulation that occurs due to power struggles

Rural studies have taken a generally less political approach, tying depopulation in landscapes to economic patterns at regional scales 







Elmhirst, Rebecca. 2011. Introducing new feminist political ecologies. Geoforum 42: 129-132



As a subfield of Geography, PE focuses on poverty, social justice, politics with respect to nature, and neoliberalisation

Intersection with feminist objectives has led to development of feminist PE via Rocheleau et al, tying PE to household analysis

FPE has emerged as market institutions have become more pervasive and rural geographic mobility has become endemic, altering resource use

FPE has also emerged as deeper understandings of female access to resources relative to men, both environmental and political, have arrived

FPE has had difficulty maintaining relevance as its ideas were incorporated into poststructural theory, but issues remain

Gender is still often taken for granted, with masculine assumptons and implicit subjects underpinning work in geography

A feminist political ecology can examine scales including the household and even the body, connecting to broader, more traditional scales







Forsyth, Tim. 2008. Political ecology and the epistemology of social justice. Geoforum 39: 756-764



Michael Watts has been a leading critic of the apparent lack of politics in a work that is avowedly political, focused on social injustice

However, a better view is that Blaikie connected coproduction social values and environmental knowledge to broader politics

Blaikie also, over time, modified his approach from purely structural to include post-modern ideas, including discourse and local values

Post modernism contributed to turn in PE that considered how certain narratives became accepted as 'true' regardless of scientific 'truth'

A second turn in PE accompanied move from equilibrium assumptions in ecology, accepting multiple stable equilibria and disequilibrium

Scholars on both sides, more political/more ecological, have criticised Blaikie and PE for being too focused on one side or the other

PE often takes a highly normative view of knowledge production, promoting empowerment of vulnerable, autonomy of local, over central power

Social and scientific epistemologies are not necessarily opposed, but not the same either, each is constrained by other, legitimacy key

Difference between symmetric and co-production models of politicization of environment claims is important

Symmetric views are classical, sees truths as emerging from different independent social structures, tied to actor-network theory

Co-production sees social orders producing knowledge, allowing re-examination of society and truths to be beneficial to vulnerable

Blaikie's work is concerned with vulnerable, PE seeks to counter power narratives and measures of environment that disadvantage the weak







Hagerman, Chris. 2007. Shaping neighborhoods and nature: Urban political ecologies of urban waterfront transformations in Portland, Oregon. Cities 24(4): 285-297



*Urban political ecology with a postmodern bent, looking at Portland OR waterfront gentrification and social construction of nature

Portland is a widely liked city with high quality transportation infrastructure, cycling opportunity, and a reputation for high liveability

PDX is also known for its planning focus, and the effort to revitalize formerly industrial waterfront districts to be high-price housing

Livability discourse ties economic, social, and natural systems together an co-produces a joint system, maybe at expense of social justice

State planning has pushed Portland to go high density, and the process in the city hasbeen met with significant citizen involvement

Waterfront district was formerly industrial, site of production then breakup of Liberty ships, with associated toxic legacy

Gentrification of neighborhood mitigates toxicity to river and produces income for the City as well as allowing growth

However it has taken place without much attention to historic relegation of minorities to waterfront housing, implies they must move

The vision of liveability embraced in waterfront reflects predominantly wealthy white concerns re-attracting suburban 'exiles'

Liveability itself is a very malleable concept not easily tied to political strains of thought in society, invoked then defined much of time

It does tend to be tied to retreat from postwar suburbanization and auto dependence, embracing walkability and remembered landscapes

Growth orientation is moderated by public input valuing green space, character in architecture, sense of nature and authenticity

However, existing parks only superficially reconnect springs/creeks to Willamette, nature not fully 'restored

PDX lessons: gentrification narratives too narrow, power is unevenly held, development meditates with public via liveability discourse







Harrill, Rich. 1999. Political Ecology and Planning Theory. Journal of Planning Education and Research 19: 67-75



*Superficial application of political ecology to planning theory, fails to mention virtually any other known PE scholars (in geography)

Planning does not take place in a value-free context, and previous paradigms emphasized top-down control without addressing bias therein

Emphasis on sustainability has theoretically challenged this, but is largely being used as a metaphor for business as usual

PE is valuable to planners in actually discussing details of sustainability, engaging with political considerations inside institutions

Planners must evolve to take a position between decision making and citizens, helping to negotiate barriers and misunderstandings







Hinchliffe, Steve. 2008. Reconstituting nature conservation: Towards a careful political ecology. Geoforum 39: 88-97



Nature conservation theory tends to be inherently about eternally preserving presently located things, but in practice presence is not clear

Simply trying to establish presence in the context of a threatened species poses challenges that meld into discourse around its conservation

A fixed sense of nature is not particularly helpful in investigations, because nature itself is not fixed in place and time

Nature is made, and the process of its making plays into PE by tying together politics, discourses, and development to created natures

Neither nature nor politics is entirely stable, a backdrop for the other, and assuming stability in either reduces the other

Nature is so produced that the presence of an aspect of it is not always straightforward to identify, as in case of UK black redstarts

Bird is predominantly European, with only a small UK population that tends to prefer 'bomber ecology' and particular nests, hard to pin down 

But even this lack of clearly assessed presence has contributed to positions taken in development, where mere likely presence has meaning

Fairly simple processes give rise to 'likely presence' idea, and developers tend to liase with conservationists to develop in pro-bird way

Both sides know a drawn out regulatory situation will occur if conservation rules go into effect, so they negotiate to avoid that conflict

The nature of the bird itself makes it difficulty positive ID presence in area, low numbers, difficulty of IDing song in noisy area, umw

Establishing presence is very difficult, but uncertainty and delay inhibit developers, who prefer to mitigate in anticipation of finding

The need to provide a certain habitat however creates use for waste materials, possibly offsetting costs, further emphasizing prevention

Water voles pose similar challenges, and together these cases help move conservation away from static preservation to a dynamic system

Even within a population there can be significant variations in local groups, further degrading ideas of staticness in ecology

A careful political ecology must take into account the freedom of action and non-constant makeup of political or ecological entities

*Problems with this article in citations not being present in bibliography

The South can be seen as a fertile area for view as being produced by historically contingent processes affecting society and nature

PE is beginning to move to address issues in the developed/1st World, as discipline has accepted 1st world PE as being viable area

Racial and social inequality in the South as in Appalachia are of importance in understanding PE in 1st world







Kimura, Aya Hirata and Katano, Yohei. 2014. Farming after the Fukushima accident: A feminist political ecology analysis of organic agriculture. Journal of Rural Studies 34: 108-116

The Fukushima accident caused contamination and potential for contamination in one of Japan's most productive agricultural areas

Communities tied to natural resources are vulnerable to disasters, but effects are felt differentially, and often by women more than men

Organic farmers are additionally more vulnerable to contamination disasters because of their customers' typical focus on health

In Japan, risk perception of radiation exposure tended to be differential based on gender, with men accepting it more readily/outwardly

Women in farming households appear to have had to either conform to male decisions or pursue separation in many cases

FPE is focused on power relations at the local and household scale, where access to resources are often split by gender

Fukushima contamination is not uniform, safety thresholds were reconstructed after the disaster, making local understanding difficult

TEPCO and government perceived dishonesty rebounded on Fukushima residents, who were seen as complicit in covering up disaster scope

Japanese organic farmers typically rely on community supported agriculture outlets, which often significantly reduced orders post 3/11

Tensions occurred between consumers and organic producers, consumers suspicious of contamination and honesty of producers

Farmers had to make the decision to stay or leave, affected by family ties to land and ability to earn income off-farm, community obligation

Hegemonic masculine narratives dominated at national level, constraining response options nationally and at household level

Patriarchical components of Japanese society contributed to many male attachments to family land when women's health concerns were pro-evac







Kirkpatrick, Jamie. 2000. The Political Ecology of Biogeography. Journal of Biogeography 27(1): 45-48



Politicians and other members of established elite have effectively accepted 'growthism' - unlimited capacity to expand global economy

Growthist paradigm fails to take into account finite limits to growth inherent in the biosphere, give finite planetary size

Short term thinking even dominates scientific inquiry, which is strongly tied to the next big thing in methods even when old are sufficient

Other scientists bury themselves in their work, avoiding engagement with such trends, and a few try to engage constructively with paradigms

Biogeography can aid in saving some of the natural world as society moves through growthism, with preserves being a common means of preserv.







Le Billon, Philippe. 2001. The political ecology of war: natural resources and armed conflicts. Political Geography 20: 561-584



*Somewhat tangentially related to core PE, takes postmodern elements and ties to political geography debates about conflict

Conflict and natural resources go together, with resource rich export-driven countries often at higher risk of experiencing armed conflict

PE has generally not dealt with large-scale conflict, and has often insufficiently treated politics in its work

Resources are perceived as such when constructed in terms of scarcity or abundance, when values are placed on objects by people

Advocates of scarcity bringing war believe that people/nations fight harder the scarcer the item perceived as a vital resource

Innovation, trade, state diversification, human capital development all counteract the scarcity=conflict hypothesis

Abundant resources are also hypothesized to cause conflict, allowing power groups the ability to loot and fund their own power growth

However there are numerous cases of resource-rich entities that are not prone to conflict (Norway), and social construction not engaged

Resources can enable states to rely on rents, buying off populations, and inhibiting development of normal terms of trade - 'Dutch disease'

Transformation of nature to exploitable resources is a political process, can result in resort to violence that never ends

'Lootability' - ability to easily secure resource, can stoke conflict as incentives exist to loot from small to large scales

Location of resource is important in understanding its relationship to power, ease of projecting power (nearness) affects competition

Fragmentation of resource control in a nation can lead to inhibited institutions, allow conflict to persist and fragmentation as well

Conflict typology: state control (point/proximate), rebellion (diffuse/proximate), secession (point/distant), warlordism (diffuse/distant)

Conflict is then tied to the geographic position of the resource (proximate/distant) and its concentration in space (point/diffuse)

Resources are rarely cause of conflict, but become targets of conflict as it develops, control of resources supports militant action







Mann, Geoff. 2009. Should political ecology be Marxist? A case for Gramsci's historical materialism. Geoforum (40): 335-344



PE has deep roots in Marxist thought, but its adherence to Marxism has waned as years have passed, even in terms of historic materialism

Gramsci may serve as an excellent mediator between Marxism and modern PE, particularly via historical materialism and hegemony

PE often relies on Foucault and infrequently engages with Gramsci, although the latter may be more in line with PE origin philosophy

Gramscian PE cannot be wholly scholarly, as work is embedded in social context from which it springs and this is controlling

PE is heavily tied to materialism, but needs to embrace the ideological components to fully incorporate it, else risks 'vulgar materialism'

Moral claims are as important as material means of production, as hegemony relies on normamtive claims by dominant groups

PE tends to divide itself into politics that focuses on environmentalism and politics that focuses itself on social justice

Peasant studies, moral economy, and green marxism all provide foundations for PE connected to broader Marxist thought

Structural materialism in its vulgar, strict form does not allow for ideas to matter, but hegemony relies on them and control of them

The ethical-political root of hegemony and materialism is necessary as it allows dynamism and radical change in affairs to take place

Leninist strains in Marxism moved towards such vulgar materialism, positing all factors as arising externally to human consciousness

Gramsci argues that ideology precedes politics, is necessary component, ties hegemony to power to ideology, prescribes intentional PE effort

PE is then inherently ethical, and needs to explicitly engage with its ethics, to argue, for example, why marginalization is 'bad'







Miklian, Jason. 2012. The Political Ecology of War in Maoist India. Politics, Religion & Ideology 13(4): 561-576



Conflict and PE can be linked, with relations of production and control of resources being cause of and object of conflict between groups

Popular theories of conflict emphasize 'Greed vs. Grievance' and 'incentives vs. Opportunities' paradigms, which are broadly similar

Each tends to emphasize unitary, rational actors, focus on conflicts over specific commodities like diamonds, ignore corporations

Companies themselves are participants in conflict, negotiating with different groups to secure access to profitable resources

Corporations become partners in conflict or source of resources, their behavior influences conflicts, can stoke or mitigate them

They can become targets of conflict if perceived as seizing resources belonging to other groups, even the state, as with POSCO in India

All actors struggle for legitimacy in conflict areas in order to lay foundation for their own moral authority over actions/resources







Natterandm, Wolfgang and Zierhoffer, Wolfgang. 2002. Political ecology, territoriality and scale. GeoJournal 58: 225-231



Conservation is ill-served by the human-nature duality, which has given way to epistemic stance of human and nature co-existing, co-producing

PE has shown that mastering nature inherently creates hierarchical relations in society and institutionalizes mechanisms of control

Governance itself is transformed under PE thought, emphasising dynamic shifting alliances of groups rather than strict government relations

Ideas of territory and scale are not wholly free of colonial thought patterns, but are still useful frames for PE analysis and thought

Territory can be linked to attributes at a location but also are fluid, moving and changing, little is static

Urban is often thought of as being entirely human, tied to modernity, and wilderness was also conceived in relation to 'tamed' urban 

PE must take into account fluidity between scales and territories, and how ideas of each are produced/expressed in interest of groups







Nesbitt, J. Todd and Weiner, Daniel. 2001. Conflicting environmental imaginaries and the politics of nature in Central Appalachia. Geoforum 32: 333-349



Appalachia extends from New York to Georgia, and is typically associated with poverty, natural resource extraction, underdevelopment

It has been theorized in the context of poverty/culture, internal colony/terms of ownership/trade, internal periphery/nonautonomous colony

Regional history, local imaginaries, place-based ideas all contribute to nature/resource politics and conflicts in Appalachian PE

Emphasis on 'outsider' is common in area, with perceived local and outsider imaginaries set in conflict in minds of landholders

Appalachia is known for coal production, but timber production also essential to area's environmental history, both tie to industrialization

Railroad development stimulated early conflict between farmers and outsiders, commercialization increased agricultural impacts

Farm sizes decreased over time while significant tracts of timber land were sold to outsiders, exploitation caused major impacts

Large forest landholders fall under tax system which causes increased burden for local taxation to fall on local jurisdictions

People in West Virginia experienced marginalization in both spatial and economic dimensions, relegated to relative poverty

External environmental regulation and the ownership of land/exclusion of locals by distant interests limit sustenance activities

Fear of further dispossession is rife among landholders, oppositional imaginary predominates, hostility to environmentalists

External environmental organizations seeking preserves on land are perceived as continuing history of local dispossession

Migration of wealthy outsiders purchasing second homes also seen as a threat to local history and livelihoods







Neumann, Roderick. 2009. Political Ecology: theorizing scale. Progress in Human Geography 33(3): 395-406



Zimmerer and Bassett ID a 'productive tension' between PE and broader Human Geography, this can support development of theory

Scale is vital to geographic thought and in PE, but HG has considered dispensing with scale partly due to confusion between scale and size

Future conceptions of scale ought to be considered in light of scalar practices, relations of power, to create PE of scale

A debate whether PE has over-emphasized essential superiority of the local over other scales, PE replies hierarchy can remove local agency

Sayre argues that scale has epistemological and ontological qualities, some patterns observable only at certain scales, relate in ways

Sayre ties appropriate scale to smallest observable point as initial scale, level where observation is possible key for higher scales

Manson consideres scale to be produced both in ecology and society, relies on 'epistemological scale continuum' with distinct ontologies

McCarthy relies on production of scales by actors, such as NGOs which build and argue ideas of scale as a tactic or strategy

Swyngedouw has worked to bridge social/ecological gap, seeing differentially produuced scales that overlap and are compatible, allows nesting

Productive synthesis found in 3 themes: action, agency, scale interactions, social/ecological processes/scaling, networks

PE can and does engage with scale, emphasizing co-production and political dynamics by actors, malleability of the concept







Neumann, Roderick. 2010. Political Ecology II: theorizing region. Progress in Human Geography 34(3): 368-374


Concept of region common in geography and PE, from Blaikie regional PE in material terms to Peet&Watts regional discursive tendencies

Agreement present that regions are "relational, historicized, contextualized and dynamic" in both strains of PE

Region somewhat addressed in theory by early PE, Zimmerer aided, emphasis on physical conditions, peasant agency, complexity in interaction

Region is often identified in broad continental terms which ignores significant variation and ties to 1st world/3rd world binary conception

To a certain extent region is discursively and co-productively defined via interactions between nature and society over given space

Resource literature and PE overlap to provide a physical conception of region tied to resource identification and production

Place and identity interact with economics and power to produce a particular set of conditions in certain areas, can be seen as region

Contingent factors in resources, labor to exploit affect capital's structure in material terms, in turn affecting labor power

Scale ties to region in important ways that are under-theorized, region definitions specific to scale (Am. West) can damage theorization





 

Neumann, Roderick. 2011. Political Ecology III: theorizing landscape. Progress in Human Geography 35(6): 843-850



Landscape is not strongly theorized in early PE, but developments in PE and new cultural geography intersect to produce new conceptions

Binaries, discontinuities in history, not helpful in producing landscape theory, discourse and co-production are common emphasis

Even the production/consumption binary in landscapes is insufficient, as landscapes can be both simulataneously to different groups

Experienced history is sometimes missed by discourse analysis, and there are material aspects of landscapes worth considering

Landscapes are sites of colonialist narratives, and even modern debates mirror colonial discourse at times, minimizing material factors

PE addresses daily routines in material terms, but then tends to be too localized in ways that are not particularly helpful for theory

PE and geography both are stronger for their interdisciplinarity, but this causes trouble when same term is defined differently in places

PE and HG do not always interact effectively when it comes to theorizing landscapes, although both have much to offer one another







Nygren, Anja, and Rikoon, Sandy. 2009. Political Ecology Revisited: Integration of Politics and Ecology Does Matter. Society & Natural Resources: An International Journal 21 (9): 767-782



There exists a tendency in PE to emphasize political dynamics at the expense of ecological dynamics, marginalizing role of natural sciences

PE in fact, in its postmodern turn, tends to focus on deconstructing authoritative scientific narratives, emphasicing social construction

PE is rooted in interdisciplinary work stemming from anth. & geo. and pulling in soc. polisci. and envi.sci elements

Origins in cultural ecology, left adaptation for political interactions, but took postmodern turn in the 90's

PE needs to engage with nature as an actor in its own right, albeit not explicitly strategic as are human actors

Local ecology is as significant as local politics in determining land use, perceptions of people interact with motion of nature

Nature has a way of acting unpredictably, as in otter reintroduction in Missouri, wolf reintroduction in Yellowstone

Hybrid connections across scales and between many actors are importantn in PE that sets ecology and politics on equal ground

Perramond, Eric P. 2007. Tactics and Strategies in Political Ecology Research. Royal Geographic Society with IBG 39 (4): 499-507



The concept of adaptation is problematic, visible only over lone time frames, with short time frame 'adaptations' being rooted in choices

Adaptation was taken from biology, where it focuses on fitness in natural selection, modification to fit environment, or survival in niche

Adaptation in human terms is difficult to demonstrate, because what may seem adaptive may simply reflect a temporally specific human effort

The concept of tactics and strategy may better describe human actions on short time frames, can be used intead of 'events' v. Vayda/Walters

Tactics involve short term, on the spot 'lived practice' that take place without control over broader context of conditions of action

Strategies involve planned courses of action, attempts to explicitly control context and conditions, achieve objective

Tactics are not simply reactions in a place and time without consciousness, they are considered and adopted intentionally by people

Defines PE as 'approach that combines the concerns of ecology and political economy' *similar to Blaikie/Brookfield, without attribution

Argues that most PE is simply Political Economy of natural resources that presents narratives rather than testable hypothesis

Rangan, Haripriya and Kuhl, Christian A. 2009. What makes ecology 'political'?: rethinking 'scale' in political ecology. Progress in Human Geography 33 (1): 28-45



Scale is a concept of key importance in PE, with debates on whether scale is emergent, tied to 'pregiven containers', or a social concept

Plant transfers are often portrayed as an imperial project, with species not native to an area marked invasive

However, humans have been serving as agents for plant movement for a long time, either intentionally or unintentionally (seed carriers)

It is important to recognize that ecological change is always underway, and that its politicization is due to humans

'Operation, observation, and interpretation' are social action moments that serve to represent ecological change in certain ways

Blaikie and Brookfield's treatment of scale effectively reduce it to 'hierarchical order of spatial categories' from household to global

Zimmerer and Bassett believe PE needs to integrate scale that is socially constructed with scale produced by bio/eco/geo processes

Robbins looks to actor-network theory as a means of engaging with the problem of scale in PE, tying it to connections between groups

PE is arguably inherently tied to questions of scale, which can productively be viewed as an interaction site where ecology is made political

Time, space, power interact to produce scale perceptions at the operational level, but even here there is malleability in the concept

Operational scale is tied to measurement and control via parameterization and the conditions of research set by scientists 

Interpretive scale is tied to discourse, emerges from ideas, categorizations, and so on that are mediated by rationality and emotion

Conjunction of ecological and social processes effectively create and reproduce scale and make ecology political







Robbins, Paul. 2003. Political ecology in political geography. Political Geography 22: 641-645


Convergence between political ecology and political geography has taken place, although the two are on different overall paths

Political geography tends to be interested in environmental issues but from a particular stance, ecologies not presented as dynamic

Politics in PE are often rooted in local-level conflicts over resource access, and analysis is not always appropriate at broader scales

The two fields tend to do well in areas where the other is not as effective, but convergence is a viable and interesting potential




Robbins, Paul, and Sharpe, Julie T. 2003. Producing and Consuming Chemicals: The Moral Economy of the American Lawn. Economic Geography 79 (4): 425-451


Lawns cover, likely, at least 23% of urban spaces with a growing total lawn land cover every year as these expand, making them important

Lawncare is a 8.9 billion plus industry with more than 49 million households participating in some way in lawn maintenance purchases

Affluent Americans tend to be most aware of and concerned about lawn chemicals, and the most likely to use them

Environmental actions are best seen, even in 1st world context, as rooted in larger processes (social political, so on) at multiple scales

Explanation is rooted in economic imperatives/marketing push for customers, grass aesthetic supported by this, and desire for authentic work

Industrial interests face shrinking profit margins and so need to expand markets, turn to identity advertising to build such markets

Lawn is both production and consumption site where families are expected to enjoy 'nature' and social cohesion is demonstrated publicly

Lawn chemicals end up inside homes and embedded in carpets, where children face disproportionate exposure and harm is little studied

Existing economic theory focuses on individual rationalities, but home lawns are not predicted using Hardin commons tragedy conceptions

Lawn expansion and maintenance is better explained by interaction of social construction and the moral economy of neighborhood members

Lawns are socially constructed as areas where families can interact with nature and engage in 'meaningful' work

Ultimately same patterns of 3rd world PE are found in 1st world: land managers responding to social expectations of community, in surplus

also the role of businesses in needing to protect material surpluses by expanding markets and convinving people to participate

Moral economy of 1st world is tied to alienation in community which is countered by consumption in response to declining institutions

Businesses face tight markets, regulation, seasonality of their business, and the role of patent regulation, so seek markets







Robbins, Paul, and Bishop, Kristina Monroe. 2008. There and back again: Epiphany, disillusionment, and rediscovery in political ecology. Geoforum 39: 747-755



PE initially filled a need for integrative, systems based theory that connected social processes to ecological crisis

Disillusionment set in by the 90s and the post-structuralist, postmodern phase via Blaikie PE's tendency to consider everything in complexity

Rediscovery has taken the postmodern turn and incorporated emerging issues in the developing world such as HIV/AIDS

Treatment of HIV/AIDS for example is tied to interacting traditional and modern medicine regimes, access to former restricted in cases

Disease is an example of a process that cannot be completely deconstructed by post-modern patterns, it clearly has a material effect

It may be valuable to take the basic components and thrusts of PE and apply them to academic research and its incentives







Rocheleau, Dianne E. 1991. Gender, Ecology, and the Science of Survival: Stories and Lessons from Kenya. Agricultural and Human Values Winter-Spring 1991: 156-165



Gender is an important category to consider in sustainability issues, often overlooked in scientific data collection and narratives

Global change is experienced at the local level, with important studies taking place at the local in order to understand global

Indigenous knowledge is disappearing as are local species, and understanding either necessitates in depth examination of local people

Gendered knowledge needs to be incorporated holistically, not simply a collection of discrete facts, and accorded its own logic

An incorporation of traditional biological empiricism and ethnographic narrative is possibly a path to embracing gendered knowledge

Information needs to be seen as flowing both to and from between the global and the local, in an egalitarian manner

Households typically exhibit gendered division of duties and traditional property or resources, locally defined and negotiated

Researchers trying to present wood species to womens groups were frustrated until the women realized the variety of species available

Males were predominantly concerned with marketable species, women with food/fruit, and assumed researchers were offering market types

Women would experiment with strategies, types, umw and seek to achieve goals proper to their context, surviving famine their own way

Fruit trees were utilized as reserve assets in lieu of cash to mitigate famine dangers, tried new crops for domestication in situ

Males and females exhibited different education and employment paths, males lost traditional knowledge and pursued market economy jobs

Wealthy males under conditions of drought were seen to be tied via obligations and negotiations to female need to use lands for subsistence

Just seeking to understand and record womens knowledge can have an effect on their practices and ability to survive/adapt to change







Rocheleau, Dianne E. 1995. Maps, Numbers, Text, and Context: Mixing Methods in Feminist Political Ecology. Professional Geographer 47 (4): 458-466



It is important in postmodern approaches to approach women not as a pure identity group, but an affiliation that is fluid

'Who counts, who is counted, and in what context' is important to consider in feminist empirical work

Pure objectivity is not viable in post-modern thought, but subjectivity needs, once accounted for, to be classed for empirical work to happen

New mixed methods can move beyond old-style positivism and engage in new, innovative methodologies like participatory counter-mapping

Gender differences and the variable participation genderedness are important to consider, as are gendered interests

To engage with policy narratives it can be necessary to find some sort of 'counting' mechanism to engage with positivism

Counter-mapping can serve as a technique to identify different spatial perceptions broken down by gender that connects to landscapes

Remote sensing can serve to obscure gender as gendered processes and material conditions are not always apparent from a remote position

To identify gendered patterns without priviliging dominant narratives it is important to know what to look for in a gendered context

Incorporating women and gendered perspectives directly, not as an added component, is essential to uncovering dynamics in many cases 







Rocheleau, Dianne E. 2008. Political ecology in the key of policy: From chains of explanation to webs of relation. Geoforum 39: 716-727



One of the core potentials of early PE a la Piers Blaikie was its ability to engage with policy, and development officials saw his work

Officials often rely on local knowledge to get things done, particularly in formerly colonized areas where officials were adapting

PE with policy relevance via Blaikie emphasizes: 1. 'multiple methods, objectives, actors, and audiences',

2: integrating social/biophysical aspects of power relations and environment effects 3: Analysis that crosses scales

4: Household/local empirical work and data collection 5: 'Chains of explanation combining structure and agency'

Multiple audiences appeal is a common failing of PE, but slowly the body of literature is growing in this area

Hybrid research is common in PE, with participant observer and scientific type analysis exemplifying common mixed methods

PE scholars interested in policy share a moral economy of sorts, with applied work being sometimes distrusted, but necessary

Academia itself is not unfamiliar with dirty battles and compromised incentives, so applied work with consulting firms not inherently bad

Integration across different fields, methods, analytic types is typical in PE and essential to much future useful work

PE can also engage productively with activist groups with an explicit ethical alliance inherent in much work in the field

Key areas of future research include liberation ecologies, post-structural PE, FPE, participatory/practical applied PE

PE also must address the scientific roots, allowing for hybrid science + complexity to incorporate with discourse and the like







Rocheleau, Dianne & Roth, Robin. 2007. Rooted networks, relational webs and powers of connection:

Rethinking human and political ecologies. Geoforum 38:433-437



Network theories provide an opportunity for integrating the human and natural sciences, crossing the divide between social and eco systems

A 'radical empiricism' via 'epistemology of allies' can tie together complex structures in networks

Power exists, must be accounted for, networks are linked to territories, social and natural networks must be equally joined, dynamism key

Power needs to be conceived of from beneath and internal to networks and not all connections in networks are necessarily positive

Networks can be seen in PE as 'relational webs shot through with power'. and power is of essential importance in PE

Terms of connectivity are important, not every relationship is equal, network structure is important, connection strength also

Social-ecological networks are made and unmade in the context of continuous interactions, such connections are material and similar to bio

'Challenge is to mesh social, ecological and technological domains in theories and models of rooted networks, relational webs, and self-organized assemblages, all laced with power, and linked to territories across scale'

While a global political ecology is not likely possible, incorporating it into regional, 1st world areas seems quite viable

The 1st/3rd world theoretical split may itself be untenable as a concept, even if a universal global PE is not viable

McCarthy was one of the early voices advocating the expansion of PE, St. Martin produced a work that was exceptional and set tone for follow

Subsistence activities can be observed taking place even at the heart of capitalism, though studying such can pose ethical issues

Growing trend in researchers examining political ecology closer to home or in a more global context, addressing new questions

Globalization of production and consumption is altering status quo and having effects across the world, similar in ways in many places

Links now exist that did not before in fields ranging from GMO prevalence to fair trade certification, tying varied regimes together

Deindustrialization coupled with significant changes in agriculture in the developed world have created a 3rd world within the 1st world

Migration from less developed areas to areas of greater wealth and development is bringing cultural and economic practices

Abstract rationalism is running into community conceptions and constructions of both natural processes and methodological appropriateness



Simon, David. 2008. Political ecology and development: Intersections, explorations, and challenged arising from the work of Piers Blaikie. Geoforum 39: 698-707

* Retrospective on Piers Blaikie's career, not heavily theoretical but provides good coupling of Blaikie's path to PE's development


Original thrust of Blaikie's work and early PE was to tie structural Marxist theory to issues in development and associated impacts

Although Marxist thought seems somewhat anachronistic now, it has to a certain degree held up over time, may need to be re-inserted in PE

PE and development integration also enabled the integration of social and natural system dynamics, a relatively new concept in the 80s

Actual systems analysis is often invoked as a good idea, but rarely carried out in practice, undermining move to holism

Details pose a problem for theorization, as they undermine assumptions and global narratives, complicating analysis

One of Blaikie's long term achievements has been to maintain concern for political economy, but in a flexible way, allowing evolution

PE may find valuable future engagement with sustainable livelihoods analysis, even as SLA is somewhat superficially apolitical







Turner, Matthew D. 2014. Political ecology I: An alliance with resilience? Progress in Human Geography 38(4): 616-623



Resilience is becoming a trending phrase in scientific and governmental literature, even as social-ecological systems become more complex

The term is, however, hybrid and varied in definition, which lets it show up everywhere but more useful in discourse than theory

Hoewever, PE and resilience can potentially interface, as each is rooted in systems thinking and complex social-ecological systems

Both concepts challenged equilibrium assumptions in society and ecology, emphasizing instead multiple equilibria and non-linear interactions

PE has distanced from early systems focus, and gone far more place-based in practice, tying resource access to power to ecosystems

Resilience literature has remained more systems focused, seeking more quantitative approaches, liking rational choice and ecological econ

PE is also highly normative in its conception, tied to concerns about social justice and impacts of power on lives of local people

Resilience literature often stakes a claim of being not normative, tied to observation, concerned with whether systems persist or not

Parameterization in social side of SES becomes difficult, but even choice of parameters in ecological side is fraught with normative thought

Land use ecology could be a functional area for collaboration, as PE is heavily concerned with the how of resource use compared to how much

PE criticizes resilience for overreach, but also hold the greatest potential for collaboration in portions of their research agendas







Turner, B.L. III, and Robbins, Paul. 2008. Land-Change Science and Political Ecology: Similarities, Differences, and Implications for Sustainability Science. Annual Review of Environment and Resources 33:295-316



There is a significant degree of complementarity between PE and LCS although each emerges from different core questions and methods

Both are subfields of geography with a debt to past, now archaic traditions, as in German Landschaft via von Humboldt

Both recognize the existence of humans and the environment in a complex, dynamic system that is not always amenable to reduction

Together both can be seen as critical elements of emerging sustainability science, emphasizing new interdisciplinary trends

PE however has far more embraced critical theories, questioning the nature of the scientific endeavor and adopting constructivist epist.

LCS is rooted more in expansion of methods in remote sensing and GIS to address modern landschaft issues, and tied to physical environment

It is reasonable to see PE as concerned more with the people, LCS the nature, sides of SES, touching on the other but rooted in primary area

LCS likes to look at land systems, institutional governance, and is amenable to incorporating resilience concepts

PE is more heavily focused on the political economy of SES, and tie research to reduction in vulnerability/increase in sustainability

PE also tends to start small and local, while LCS is more directly concerned with processes that may be emergent, generalizable

Vulnerability has so far been a key area of cooperative work between the two areas, and theforest transition in areas has been another

Both recognize that there are global connections to local processes and connections between same-scale things, accept complexity

'LCS and PE may be so fused in problem framing and methods that concept of a hybrid land change or ecology is not far fetched'

in the Mexican Municipio of Alamos. Human Organization 63:1 21-33



Alamos, Sonora, has been the site of a clash between land use patterns following economic specialization and communal subsistence production

It is essential to set the political and ecological components of PE side by side to fully understand them, rather than privilege either

How people use resources, how they perceive their environment and systems, key, also obtaining perspective of direct users of

*Study uses both interviews of resource users and satellite remote sensing based surveys of land cover change to understand issues

Introduction of new form of grass to improve cattle grazing efficiency and increase stock has had environmental effects via grass behavior

Grass tends to dry easily, not eaten by cattle when dry, burns easily when dry, altering fire regimes, is sensitive to climate, takes over

Communial ejidatarios tend to have small farms, largest number of farmer/rancher, but with less total land area and head of cattle

Conflict also between environmentalists and producers, latter preferring new grasses when they allow for improved effectiveness

Attempt to create reserve in area falls primarily on lands of ejidos, making them resistant to such a reserve, environmentalists ignore them

Sustainable rural areas where people can pursue livelihoods depend on understanding the complex adaptive behavior of local land managers

*Another post-modern heavy paper, with limited utility, primarily discussing Edward Said's contributions and connections to Gramsci



Focus on scale and tying it to specific named regions in cartesian system limits conceptualization of processes, ignoring their 'becoming'

All geographic concepts essentially emerge from social structures, politics, language, so on, so possibly related to hegemony

Fixed ideas of the past or future are not essential to Gramsci or Said, allowing for constructing meaning in open way

Even naming a region like 'America' obscures the fact that this concept is a melange of structures, power centers, groups, the state, so on







Walker, Peter A. 2003. Reconsidering 'regional' political ecologies: toward a political ecology of the rural American West. Progress in Human Geography 27 (1): 7-24



Originating in 3rd/less developed/rural world, PE has since 2000 been applied to 1st/developed/urban world contexts

These frames are not ideal due to commonalities unveiled by PE but eliminating them for universality poses new problems

There are distinctive processes at work, possibly better examined on a regional rather than developmental level frame

PE is often highly eclectic, scattered in focus, difficult to even define, an issue that has been exacerbated by postmodern thought

A core of PE focuses on marginalization, chains of explanation, focus on direct resource users, exploitation and surplus accumulation

In developed context, moral economy, low level politics, discourse often hidden, obscuring social and relational concepts of rights

Colonial perspectives still provide an undercurrent in 1st world discourse, particularly in American West region

First World tends to require analysis of government agencies and policy, recognition of embedded capitalist modes of production

Region focus allows sidestep away from 1st/3rd world dichotomy, also enables a comparative approach to examine differences

American West sees conflict between trio of capitalist modes: resource extraction, development, amenity migration

Am. West characterized by move from extractive resource use to consumptive use via a period of rapid industrialization during war/coldwar

Heavy federal ownership of land (50% or more) and significant private investment via rich characterize changing landscapes and values

Significant gentrification occurs, long time locals unable to afford living costs, rural livelihoods become impossible via change in values

Local focus traditionally in PE problematic when locals only present on landscape for 150 years, land having been taken from natives

State capitalism for defense industry, real estate development, telecommunications function as vital regional factors to consider in west

PE needs to bridge scales to be effective, to allow commonalities in some areas to mesh with differentiation in others, understand conflict






Walker, Peter A. 2005. Political ecology: where is the ecology? Progress in Human Geography 29 (1): 73-82


High identification with political ecology by young scholars (in 2000s) indicates that the field is likely to remain dominant

Internal coherence as a discipline is at times difficult to find given the variety of questions, regions, methods addressed

Much work has been directed primarily at politics, with ecology perceived as taking a secondary role in work

The early ecological influence on PE is visible in the role played by systems theory, community ecology, and cultural adaptation in society

Hazards narratives and neomalthusian ideas also influenced early PE, but the postmodern revolution significantly impacted development

Focus on discourse, exercise of power, access to resources, and control over resources have at times left explicit ecology behind

It is key as PE develops to retain the biophysical focus alongside improved social theory







Walker, Peter A. 2006. Political ecology: where is the policy? Progress in Human Geography 30 (3): 382-395



PE, although Blaikie explicitly envisioned it engaged with policy, has often been ignored by policymakers, more often PE ignores policy

Many practitioners of PE fail to engage with policy, and the discipline's lack of cohesion at times makes it difficult to translate to pol.

PE must take responsibility for lacking compelling narratives with as much clear assertions as Population Bomb or Tragedy of Commons

Counter-narratives need to emerge from PE in order to help it have policy relevance, need to challenge established wisdom and facts

Much PE is tied to very specific, very local cases, and is somewht beholden to baggage imparted by marxist thought in its origns

To effectively address outside, non academic world, PE may need to develop a core focus, a unity not seen in its disparate approaches

PE has enourmous potential, and underutilization is default. It began normatively, and needs to accept a normative, focused future







Walker, Peter A. 2007. Political ecology: where is the politics? Progress in Human Geography 31 (3)L 363-369



It is uncertain whether PE actually lives up to its use of the term politics, it becomes effectively apolitical in its lack of voice

PE has helped to promote ideas of local power, co-production of hybrid science using local knowledge, and 'popular' PE in small areas

But PE has also fallen prey to some of the problems of academia, including exploitative research practices and lack of long term studies

PE considers itself fundamentally normative and tied to a particular ethic yet fails to adequately address its own use of power

Institutional challenges in academia are hurting PE, with focus on production, particular publications, and lack of interest in applied work

It is arguable that PE, due to its claim to ethics and normative science, has an additional obligation to make good on its promise

PE must move to recognize non purely academic results, it must address its own exploitation of subjects, is obligated to help poor/weak







Walker, Peter & Fortmann, Louise. 2003. Whose landscape? A political ecology of the 'exurban' Sierra. Cultural Geographies 10: 469-491


Nevada county has been site of contested landscape aesthetics between traditional resource users and the incoming amenity migrants

A landscape planning initiative stoked struggle between different groups with different visions of land use and landscape

No clear ownership of landscape aesthetics coupled with traditional need for active landscape use stimulates conflict

Political ecology needs to embrace studies of landscape and culture in the north in order to understand related political conflicts

Early Euro settlers saw Nevada County as 'el Dorado' with unlimited resources, a concept which aided over-exploitation and destruction

Gold Rush ran out in 19th century, landscape recovered, was utilized by farmers and ranchers, still sparsely populated in 1960s

Changing demographics led to changing political dynamic, shift of power to new in-migrants was met by hostility via old 

Different cultures also fostered conflict, rooted in expressions of identity such as dogs, how landscapes ought to look

Ultimately, political conflict was as rooted in differential visions of the appropriate landscape for the area carried by different groups







Zimmerer, Karl S. 1994. Human Geography and the "New Ecology": The Prospect and Promise of Integration. Annals of the Association of American Geographers, 84(1):108-125



'New Ecology' refers to recognition in the 1980s that previous assumptions of equilibrium in ecological systems were insufficient

dynamism, disequilibrium, instability, even chaos are now recognized as being essential characteristics of ecosystems, altering assumptions

Irregular time dynamics and new metaphors for communicating ecological systems are essential components of the new ecological paradigm

Many social sciences have borrowed from ecological language and thoughts, and those that have assumed tendencies to equilibrium must change

Such new ecological thought challenges old metaphors of human behavior that assumed humans adapt to the environment they're in

Relatively simple constructs like carrying capacity and biodiversity are now challenged, with unequel dispersions being endemic to systems

Ecology holds a privileged position in society, even as it is a constructed field, so change to new ecology poses challenges to establishment

Heterogenity in environments poses new challenges to generalized theory, but specificity may make new ecology more similar to postmodernHG/PE






Zimmerer, Karl S. 2006. Cultural ecology: at the interface with political ecology - the new geographies of environmental conservation and globalization. Progress in Human Geography 30 (1): 63-78



The expansion of conservation areas has arguably been a major success of environmentalism, but warrants close examination for effects

It is a trend that contains both socio-spatial and discourse components, and are well-viewed as part of broader trends in globalization

Technological change has re-emphasized the importance of thinking spatially, but has been accompanied by increased network focus

Scale is another key component of the trend, as scales are more malleable and it is not possible to speak of narrowly defined landscapes

Boundary/border issues are also becoming more central to understanding conservation, as management may not match with on-ground resource use

Decentralization is an additiona component of the trend, but not always egalitarian - it has often reinforced or created new inequalities

There have been greater efforts made to allow for different uses and buffer zones mixing conservation and production

Remote sensing can help with monitoring conservation, but can reinforce power disparities and undermine local governance and concerns

Scale can be disrupted, leading to disconnects between urban-rural connections and supply networks in rural areas

Increasing interdisciplinary efforts are promising, allowing for connections to be better made between natural and human processes in dialog




Zimmerer, Karl S. 2007. Cultural ecology (and political ecology) in the 'environmental borderlands': exploring the expanded connectivities within geography. Progress in Human Geography 31(2): 227-244


The field of Geography is sufficiently broad and diverse that sub-field interactions within the field can be fertile ground for new ideas

Interaction space between methods (GIS), Human Geography (HG), Physical Geography (PG), and Nature-Society/Human-Environment creates borders

Three key interdisciplinary areas emerge: Environmental Science/Tech. Studies, Historical Environmental Geo., Global Environ. Change & Policy

Push to borderlands areas is tied to need for understanding complexity, policy relevance, and merging complex strands of thought/research

Inner connections in PE and resource Geo, non-equilibrium and dynamic ecologies, human-nature systems, and material concerns all driving push

STS framework is often influenced by effects of neoliberal patterns, can be enriched by and enrich PE via ties between local and global

STS can potentially show a path to alternatives in society, different visions of how resource use can take place and science can help

HEG perspective can be used to offer complex, deep debunking of 'pristine myth', inform new insights, detail past major events

GEC can be summed up as sustainability + justice, can address governance, Land Use-Land Cover Change, innovative forms of monitoring

GEC can incorporate place/location based long term observations that can engage people and places being monitored in beneficial way

Borderland concept can promote cross-subfield work that deeply addresses and expands early ideas like adaptation, sustainability, risk, so on

Such integrative work can better expand the area of environment-society studies to promote this view and expand it where possible
