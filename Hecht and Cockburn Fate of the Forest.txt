This text is a foundational PE case study, examining, at its core, the effects of injustice and inequality on environmental destruction



Pre-colonization and geology

Pre-colonization Amazon was home to a large indigenous population that practiced multiple resource gathering techniques to survive

Agriculture in the western sense is difficult due to poor soils and necessity of maintaining physical landscape structure for longevity

Amazon plants tend to grow on top of a thick layer of organic detritus, host vast and unique populations of pests and microbes

Natives typically partly cleared an area, planted crops that mimiced the successional re-growth of natural flora in stages

Sites no longer agriculturally productive were planted with browse crops to attract game until their fertility was restored

Amazon arises on slopes of and in between ancient 'shields' to the north and south, is characterized by numerous vast rivers

The area is rich in minerals, particularly iron, gold, and bauxite, among other minerals of modern economic importance



Colonization effects on social structures

Indigenous tribes saw their numbers severely reduced by aggression, illness, and as a result of dispossession from their lands

Portuguese and Spanish settlers were primary initial migrants, seeking bases along the coast and riches in the interior

Other Europeans came into play in the 18th and 19th Centuries, and the global market system continued their efforts in the 20th

Large numbers of African slaves were imported to aid in extraction efforts, which were typically more successful than lasting operations

Indians were enslaved, and local mestizo populations were effectively enslaved by debt peonage and threats of violence

Post-colonial patterns were structured on the colonial, with local elites taking over the role of the European colonists


Post-Colonial social relations

In 19th Century rubber became a major export from the region, collected by tappers who had to rent landowners' trees

Brazil nuts served as an additional extracted crop, and some varieties of tree were particularly prized and ravaged

Tappers were spatially bounded and poor, reliant on landowners for supplies and access to markets, exploited via price manipulations

Efforts to industrialize the area were made, but failed for numerous reasons, and rubber boom collapsed post WWII

In mid-20th century tappers came into conflict with ranchers as latter began to clear forests to support vast cattle herds

Such cattle herds were not suited to the basin in such numbers and were/are primarily meant to establish 'ownership' of lands

Tappers and other extractive users are dispossessed, forced into urban favelas, and physically assaulted if they resist

Those that remain, such as tappers and indigenous peoples, forced to exploit the Amazon however possible in order to survive

But the root of this exploitation rests with the practices of the few large landowners who expand their holdings at others' expense


Amazon futures

Resistance by tappers has long been observed, incorporating rocks or other bad materials into rubber sold to middlemen

Recent efforts have sought access to state power and protection in order to enforce conditions that support their livelihoods

Such efforts have been violently resisted by ranchers and other land clearance interests, assassinations and torture are common

State institutions have ignored, if not aided, powerful land interests' actions, leading to organized union formation among locals

International influence has been mixed - NGOs can be of help, but environmental preservation often also dispossesses locals

New strategy of creating extractive reserves dedicated to a particular use is popular with local interests, as opposed to preserves

Growing problem is mercury contamination of waters via smallholder placer mining for gold, a major recourse for locals on edge of survival

Here again, the damage wrought is tied to the forced actions of desperate people who have lost their ability to pursue other actions
