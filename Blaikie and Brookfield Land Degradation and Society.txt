Chapter 1 - Defining and Debating the Problem

Degradation implies a loss of productivity, consuming capital inputs as well as labor at a higher rate than undegraded land
Full explanations of degradation require combined social and natural science efforts, as each sphere affects the other
Land degradation occurs naturally, but interaction with humans produces a need to manage land - land manager perspective is vital
Degradation has many causes: improper land use, poor selection of lands, etc - but single hypothesis explanations rarely sufficient
Degradation's definition has a social component as different natural processes may be differentially helpful/harmful to different people
Capability of land to satisfy particular use is a better measure than value when assessing degradation
"Net degradation = (natural degrading processes + human interference) - (natural reproduction + restorative management)" P. 7
Landesque capital is defined as land management with an intent to secure future production, investment that goes beyond current crop demands
Sensitivity of land defined as "the degree to which a given land system undergoes change due to natural forces, following human interference"
Resilience of land defined as "the ability of land to reproduce its capacity after disturbance" and what human effort is needed to secure it
Resilience and sensitivity can be combined into 4-square matrix for corresponding low/low, low/high, high/low, high/high respective values 
Interactions between human and natural processes at different scales are critical to understanding degradation
Regional political ecology is approach coined here, accounting for spatial variability and the effects of political economy on ecology
Many 3rd world areas suffer from common symptoms that are largely due to incorporation into global economic system, modded by local factors
Marginality is a key idea, differently conceived in different disciplines, but typically disadvantaged people are coupled with poor lands


Chapter 2 - Approaches to the Study of Land Degradation

The approach of regional political ecology in examining a phenomenon can be described as constructing chains of explanation
Chain of explanation for land degradation begins with land managers' situation, links to inter-relationships, then to the state/globe
A major single hypothesis for land degradation follows Malthus, is summed as population pressure on resources (PPR)
PPR is present in many cases, but not all, and sometimes lack of population leads to degradation - PPR is not in and of itself sufficient
A counter to PPR a la Boserup (1976) is that increased population leads to innovation, however, this also does not appear to always hold
Intensification can be seen as any change that results in higher output from a given quantity of land
PPR can be key when it forces use of sensitive/resilient lands, undermines existing management practices/institutions, but can provide labor
Some explanations for degradation argue that land users are stupid, conservative, or lazy - particularly in the context of restoration
However, these don't actually examine why land users behave in a certain way, and they can be seen as employing a survival algorithm
Only rich land users with the capacity for absorbing risk may be able to adopt new management techniques, while the poor have no room
Pressures from remote land users, like corporate interests, can massively degrade lands intentionally and knowingly
In Nepal, PPR has allowed improved terracing, reducing erosion, although it has been accompanied by deforestation and marginal land use
In Nepal, poverty is seen as the basic cause of management that is poor, which in turn leads to deeper poverty


Chapter 3 - Measuring Land Degradation (Mike Stocking) 


The neutrality of science in terms of its process and measurements is often assumed, however this obscures many important factors
Humans are part of science, they make mistakes, they choose the context for interpretation, they are biased and ideological
Simply determining what to measure is a huge question that brings into play issues of context, prejudices, and so on
Data collection in land degradation research is likely a significant error source due to difficulty of actually measuring as well as scaling
Frequency/magnitude problems are present, low frequency big events can be a major player but be missed, or be focused on and skew results
Scale is another major issue as in erosion material moves but differently according to circumstances, fixed measurements points overestimate
Measurements have no intrinsic value and have to be put in an understandable context, some models like USLE end up being mis-used


Chapter 4 - Decision-making in Land Management

Scale is important whenever costs and benefits must be assessed due to different units of measurement, movement of study objects, umw
Actual activity important in land use may take place at a very different scale than regulation, land users benefit differentially
It is essential to identify the proper scale(s) in order to adequately connect elements of a chain of explanation
Scale is also important in many cases where solutions are proposed, scale level of focus tends to lead to different solution possibilities
Factors critical in understanding marginalization of a people may be occurring at the state or global level, requiring further scale thoughts
Temporal factors are critical as well due to spatial connections only apparent over time and events/policies with a time lag
Scale, spatial or temporal, must be tied to the situation/process being researched - scales are typically nested in one another
Land use by managers can be thought of as allocating resources of different relative scarcities to achieve/maintain income stream from land
Decisions in this vein take place in a system where actions are limited by political economy, society, institutions, umw
Land degradation must be perceived and any proposed action taken to remedy it must be viable within the systemic context
Single cause explanations are likely to fail, and governments seeking to intervene may have to address numerous factors
To understand what is happening it is important to identify both who is responsible for decision-making and what information they have
Social relations in production are essential: who has land/resources, who decides on use, what surplus results and who controls it
Property rights are often present in the social relations of production and take various forms depending on context and histor
Common property is often present in rural contexts which are managed cooperatively by some land users, possibly with different goals
Surplus production and control is essential, capitalism tends to promote such production and often removes it from local control
Pre-capitalist surplus production and accumulation was also common, but often had socially mediating elements and surplus didn't move far
Typically, land use remains in peasant hands but control over surplus extraction does not, pressures determine extent/type of land use
Some international interdependence backed by specialization has always been around, but the 19th century took this idea to a new level
Colonial processes most dramatically and rapidly achieved transformation to a globally integrated system, forcing peasants to work for export
All societies harbor conflict over resource use and surplus control, but modern capitalism tends to divide decision making from land users


Chapter 5- economic stuff, passed over


Chapter 6 - On Measurement and Policy, Scientific Method and Reality

Two key hypothesis may explain the effects of the conditions of colonialism on land management in colonized regions
One is that relations of production and extraction of surplus pressure land managers or deprive them of resources, preventing managemen
The other is that some conditions of accumulation see capitalist land users employ bioresources for short term gain, extracting profit
Colonialism was a damaging revolutionary process but there was at times good intent involved, and improved land management was an objective
In most colonies a good portion of the best land was taken by settlers, forcing more indigenous people onto fewer suitable lands
A result was that marginal lands that were otherwise not extensively used had to be occupied in order to ensure locals could survive
In some places uncultivated lands were taken by the new state and given to colonizers, excluding locals from a supportive production area
Local labor in colonies was often recruited, forcibly or via taxation, to ensure adequate supplied in colonial mining and other extractions
Bias against local methods and culture led some colonizers to view even effective land management as being inferior to Euripean methods
Many European practices such as clear felling and open-field farming were not well adapted to colonial ecologies and promoted degradation
Growing need for cash labor brought shortages of essential labor needed for production of landesque capital
There were at times effective land preservation techniques employed, which also deprived local people of needed means to support livelihoods
Hill areas have been subject to significant degradation as being typically marginal for ag and home to marginalized people under colonialism
Hill peoples tended to be more capable of resisting intervention due to terrain and the lower benefits of conquest
But damage done to trade networks, increased population pressures due to refugees, and market penetration drove intensive land use
In conservation, lack of attention to local knowledge and conditions can be devastating, and coercion of locals is often necessary


Chapter 7 - Questions from History in the Mediterranean and Western Europe

Natural variation in conditions around degradation is important, but human actions generally have precedence even when such variation is high
The Med area has seen a great deal of social change over several thousand years and climate has fluctuated significantly as well
Most indigenous forest cover is gone, montane areas are almost bare of soil, but exploitative agriculture is largely to blame
But during times of relative social calm adaptations and management progressed to deal with variation and conservation
In times of war and conflict innovations of peaceful times broke down, degradation ensued - several cycles of above have been noted
At times the climate shifts changed underlying conditions of soil movement and production, often tied to storm patterns
Human activities have at times contributed to preventing erosion rather than causing it, degradation is linked to rural population decline
Central-West Europe is characterized by less rainfall erosion aside from the little ice age than the Med, erosion tied to ploughing depth
Forest clearance and slope erosion are also tied togetgher, and removal of hedges as well, but some ploughing methods prevent erosion
In 18th century Lorraine significant productivity declines appear tied to livestock epidemics, forced labor in transportation
Pastoral and arable lands exhibit a mutually dependent relationship in Europe, with sheep grazing also providing fertilizer for farmland
Deteriorating rural conditions in ancien regime France led to rural support for the revolution, as rural areas lost resilience to crisis
Germany experienced erosion greater than France in the renaissance-industrial period and due apparently to social conflict, not climate


Chapter 8 - Degradation under pre-capitalist social systems

New Guinea provides an interesting case study because of long inhabitation, indigenous farming practices, and relatively recent globalization
Land management practices have been adapted over time, poor practices dying out and effective ones surviving because of their succcess
In the case of Easter Island poor land management resulting in deforestation mayhave been sufficiently maladaptive to destroy the culture
Pacific islands tend to have highly sensitive soil systems that can be rapidly and heavily eroded by natural processes if unvegetated
Most of society in New Guinea is village based with a system of chiefs who redistribute costs and benefits in their domain
The agriculture of New Guinea was traditionally tied to Taro cultivation in wetlands, eventual dryland farming, and pigs
Sweet potatoes were introduced relatively recently and significantly changed practices in New Guinea, with ag land expanding
Pigs function both as a cultural means of expressing wealth as well as a farming tool, providing fertilization and reducing hunting needs
Sweet potato farming helped to disrupt traditional trade networks and reinforce exiswting gender power imbalances
The changing social relationships allowed by trade controllers encouraged intensified use of more marginal lands 
Land degradation appears to be associated with exploitation of the weak in a society


Chapter 9 - Management, Enterprise and Politics in the Development of the Tropical Rain Forest Lands

Deforestation of tropical forests in support of agriculture is a source of erosion and changing land management in the modern era
Typically deforested tropics are poor in nutrients and are often seen as badly degraded, and yet they can be profitably used by local people
Increased cultivation need not necessarily lead to deforestation, however, and doesn't always do s
Changes in a given SES are responsible for existing adaptive systems being altered, often leading to degradation
Mechanization can be responsible for degradation when it destroys existing adaptive land managemet systems
In places like Malaysia and Indonesia, rural population patterns, crop choice, and ultimately land management are politically driven 
Capitalism can be seen in may developing regions as exacerbating existing political conflicts
Degradation is partly a problem of perception, as degradation from one perspective is actually beneficial from another, politics is key
In Fiji, the restriction on the majority of the population from owning or utilizing key lands leads to inequality
Where land management intersects with social patterns and existing institutions, changes must be approached with a broad view of the system


Chapter 10 - The Degradation of Common Property Resources

Common property resources: individual use but not possession, some number of users have independent use rights, users constitute collective
Distinguished from private goods and public goods, and have been around for a very long time all over the world
They are however particularly vulnerable to induced degradation, even though they can last effectively for a very long time
Characteristics of CPRs include their subtractability in use (individual damage done to others) and how excludable they are (keep others out)
Non-members of the collective are typically kept out by physical barriers and/or surveillance by members
Successful management of CPR requires reciprocity and following collectively set rules in a form of institution
Garrett Hardin's 'tragedy of the commons' thesis assumes rational users will free-ride due to the utility of doing so, so CPRs will degrade
Howeverm the 'game' where individuals decide to free-ride or not is iterative, so has temporal element, and punishment is a viable strategy
CPRs can survive for a very long time, have likely existed throughout human history, and are of increasing interest in land management
Nomads in Iran have been seen to utilize harvested crops in an area, with manure from the herds benefiting the local farmers
CPRs can fail when external pressures grow: encroachment can undermine them, so can the destruction of power centers that regulate them
Big Men refusing to follow rules, and preferentially benefiting their own interests, can undermine and destroy a CPR
In India, land reforms that removed a controlling class ended up destroying the CPR in local villages that had previously persisted
Individual plots of land belonging to ruling class and managed collectively were privatized by landholders, with incentives to over-use
Increased prices for products of CPRs in India have also been seen as a driver of over-use, as incentives to over-use improve
The decreased productivity of these CPRs in India can be tied as much or more to decreased farmer inter-regulation as over-use


Chapter 11 - Skipped because of irrelevance of socialist countries now, plus that idiot Smil


Chapter 12 - The Farmer, The State and the Land in Developed Market Economies

Conservation efforts over 50 years in the developed world have not had the desired effects, and land degradation is still an issue
Agricultural land is highly abstracted from other parts of society, marginal lands have been abandoned, and degraded lands haven't recovered
In the US and in other developed countries conservation subsidies have been tied to maintaining farm incomes rather than conservation
Small farms are largely gone, and the majority of agriculture is now managed by large entities with potentially low conservation interest
High vertical integration of agriculture supply chains has led to more energy being used in transport/marketing than growing crops
In Australia, most of the land is arguably poor for agriculture and highly susceptible to erosion
Aboriginal occupation was less dense and less land-intensive, modern occupation is now viewed with pessimism due to land sensitivity


Chapter 13 - Retrospect and Prospect

Underlying causal mechanisms of degradation include ignorance, profit-seeking, poverty, and at times population pressures
Population pressures can cause degradation but can also stimulate conservation, and which path dominates is locally dependent (PPR)
Production pressures are heightened where social relations of production focus on surplus extraction (Poverty)
Market exchanges can cause degradation through surplus extraction due to power imbalances occurring in markets (Profit-seeking)
The relationships in factors that cause degradation are complex, and misunderstanding systems is easy (Ignorance)
Wherever marked social inequality exists, whether in markets, colonial systems, feudalism, degradation due to surplus extraction is a thread
Focus on the land manager is necessary to really understand the causal mechanisms of degradation
Centralized state control is insufficient in most cases due to lack of localized knowledge
A purely populist approach is also insufficient due to pre-existing social system dynamics
Effective policy creates conditions within which effective management practices may be adopted
