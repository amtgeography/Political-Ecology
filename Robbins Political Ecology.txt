Introduction

 - Political Ecology is a diverse body of knowledge and modes of practice that addresses common questions

Chapter 1 The Hatchet and the Seed

'Human' and 'Ecological' systems are not truly separate, but intertwined and have evolved together for millenia

Apolitical explanations of human-ecological interactions fail to address how humans have exerted power to modify the joint system

Wolf appears to have coined term in 1972, and has evolved from separate approaches to use a common core of assumptions/explanatory mode

 * P.6-P.7 contains a chart of varying definitions and goals.

Apolitical ecology explanations evolved from 18th century scientific approaches, and commonly blame population for environmental damage

Malthusian population pessimists and Economist modernization evangelists both claim to apolitically explain human-environment interactions

However, even these expressly apolitical explanations depend in highly normative assumptions that themselves emerge from politics

Political ecology is "more explicit in its normative goals and more outspoken about the assumptions from which its research is conducted"

Environmental change as well as ecological conditions are produced by political processes that generate winners and losers

The conceptions held about environmental change, ecology, and the connections between people and environment are politically constructed

Political ecology simultaneously seeks to critique the existing order while providing alternative formulations of the system

Four theses are central to political ecology: degradation/marginalization, environmental conflict, conservation/control, identity/movement

Chart of the 4 theses, what they explain, and relevance on P.14

Degradation and marginalization asks the whys and hows of environmental change and connects to political/economic context

Environmental conflict looks at the problem of environmental access, who has it and why - struggles are usually gendered, classes, etc.

Conservation and control examines the whys and hows of political and economic exclusion as a means of protecting environments

Identity and social movement deals with upheaval in social systems, particularly where livelihood and environment intersect

Additional arguments revolve around community collective action, human labor in the environment, risk taking/aversion in human behavior

More arguments revolve around diversity in environmental perceptions, political corruption's causes/effects, knowledge/power relationship



Chapter 2 A Tree With Deep Roots



Kropotkin can reasonably be thought of as the foundational thinker for political ecology, although he did not use the term

He sought to combat the interpretation of Darwin that focused on struggle, arguing that mutual aid was foundational to evolution

Geography itself has a dark history as an agent of political and economic control advancing social darwinism/colonialism/exploitation

Kropotkin helped deconstruct the 'scientific' norms of his time, which assumed that social hierarchy is normal per evolution

Early PE hallmarks: focus on production, archival/field empirics, focus on marginalized, interest in trad. eco. knowledge, landscape focus

Alexander von Humboldt is referred to as the 'grandfather of modern geography' and began the 'continental critique'

He along with Elisee Reclus, Alfred Wallace, and Mary Sommerville investigated physical phenomena, but were drawn to social interactions

Ultimately they ended up connecting the two, seeing that human action rooted in power modified the environment

George Marsh and other American geographers demonstrated that apolitical explanations could be made, stunting political ecology's growth

Progress in nascent PE actually took place in Anthropology and cultural ecology via Alice Hamilton, Florence Kelly, and Jane Addams

Cultural ecology such as that of Carl Sauer at Berkeley tied human culture to land patterns instead of the reverse

Julian Steward's positivist cultural ecology sought to expand beyond description and determine theory

This in turn played into the social science quantitative revolution, as cultural ecology sought common metrics to judge all societies

A materialist focus thus evolved to take a central role, addressing production, often showing local practices to be highly adaptive

This direction unfortunately runs into issues when the logic is taken to the extreme, adaption becomes a rule and is depoliticized

Bernard Nietschmann's work with the Miskito people found that a political-economic explanation was necessary to understand dynamic change

In the end, apolitical approaches went in a tautological circle, and arguably a body of theory was needed to address causality



Chapter 3 The Critical Tools



Common property theory is at the core of political ecology, and stands in contrast to the Hardin conception of 'tragedy of the commons'

However TC doesn't stand up to a vast body of empirical evidence showing common management functioning across the world

External stresses and rules that fail to cope are to blame for commons failure, not common management itself

One major external stress is imposition of rules under the guise of preventing commons failure which appropriates common property

Marxist thought contributed by focusing on materialist interpretation of history coupled with recognition of capitalist surplus extraction

However, Marxism fails to directly address the interactions of humans with the environment which shape one another

Dependency, accumulation, degradation are linked, as capitalist surpluses extract value from and fail to care for degraded environments

PE not explicitly materialist, does assume society/culture depends on econ. acts, exogenous production regimes, global market dependency

PE is tied to political economy, must examine who benefits from resource control and who is subject to control

Peasant studies helps take materialist approach forward, using peasant households as focus of study to explain progress of history

Peasants were found by Chayanov to be drudgery-minimizing, not profit-seeking, efficiently use resources to ensure survival

Social systems of reciprocal support that feature tolerable mutual exploitation are fundamental to peasant societies

Gramsci argued that the imposition of power is not perfect, and the subjugated resist in small ways where the gaps in control exist

The role of women has been under-studied with their labor often being extracted at the household level, reinforced by cultural norms

Relegation of women to certain roles coupled with exploitation of their labor undermines societies, key knowledge is lost

Critical environmental history and political ecology are linked, but the variables of interest to latter are often difficult to study

Orientalism/colonialism creeps into apolitical theories to explain human-environment systems, often relying on us vs. them dichotomies

The role of the subaltern is important to political ecology, addressing the essential contributions of non-elites in resistance and change

Post-structuralism is also important, as power controls ideas and narratives about truth, requiring that its effects be deconstructed

Political ecology can be thought of as emerging from positivism reaching limits, the growth of critical theory, and era of global issues



Chapter 4 A Field Crystallizes



 * P.71-72 contains excellent chart of concepts and processes in political ecology

Chains of explanation are vital, connecting various forces and elements together to understand phenomena in holistic fashion

Induction can still be important, but is dangerous because it can easily mask the researcher's political bias 

Political ecology relies on theory to identify 'what to look for' when studying a human-environment system

There is an art to constructions of chains of explanation, most significant variables impacting each level of analysis need to be IDed

Starvation in the Sahel was tied to peanuts, introduced by colonial officers to provide a market-competitive food oil

Sahel was poor climate for peanuts, and global markets caused prices to collapse, drought and winds destroyed topsoil

Land expansion drove nomadic tribesfolk into poorer lands, where their herds died off, starvation ensued

Marginalization is an essential process: disempowered people pushed to poorer spaces, where they have to intensify efforts to survive

Intensification of efforts on already marginal lands degrades these lands, forcing greater intensification in a vicious cycle

Locals in Sahel had adapted to conditions for centuries, intercropping and establishing mutually supportive networks

Global markets and capitalization of economy of exchange broke social networks/moral economy, dependence on global markets grew

When a sufficiently major shock arrived in the form of a major drought the system could not cope and broke into famine

This chain of explanation and focus on system is characteristic of work in political ecology: 'silent violence' & 'land degradation...'



Chapter 5 Destruction of Nature 



Apolitical ecology argues that environmental degradation takes place due to overpopulation, selfishness, and ignorance

Political ecology counters that degradation itself is difficult to judge at times, and the notion itself is politicized

Environmental systems may well be changing in very typical cyclic patterns rather than permanently degrading from one state to another

It is the political and economic uses of an environmental system that often determines whether it is perceived as in decline

Natural productivity, biodiversity, and usefulness of an environmental system may be the best metrics of degradation

Political ecology also examines the change in risk ecology: who is made to bear the risks of environmental change the most?

Part of the difficulty in assessing apolitical degradation is lack of an observed baseline, local people may carry that knowledge best

 

Chapter 6 Construction of Nature



Many phenomena that are called 'natural' arise from social-environment interactions, perceptions rely on the construction of nature

Focus on the construction of reality goes back at least to Kant, and was carried forward by Foucault

Human imagination is seen in constructivism to be tied to social and cultural influences and responsible for constructing reality

Existing authorities in a power hierarchy rely on certain constructions to justify their continued positions of power

It is important to uncover these systems of controlled constructions in order to get to the bottom of what is actually happening

Political ecologists focus on constructions that are taken for granted, that disallow alternative interpretations, and create the world

Examining the constructions inherent in a system are important for identifying the points where powerful interests exert control

Soft constructivism is usually relied on as it allows for other factors than human agency to have meaning in a system

There is a danger in political ecologists' use of constructivism - to what extent are they simple seeking to enthrone new constructions?

Environmentalists have constructed views of 'nature' that inform specific efforts in restoration, possibly damaging the real nature

Although people closest materially to nature often have deep knowledge bases, their views are often discounted by 'experts'

There can be significant conflict when attempts are made to connect traditional knowledge with that produced by science

Discourse analysis, local narratives, counter-mapping, taxonomies, and geneologies can help use local knowledge to id constructions



Chapter 7 Degradation and Marginalization



Degradation and Marginalization are systematic and recurring consequences of state development initiatives and global market integration

Local systems of production that have been sustainable for long periods become unsustainable due to the new pressures placed on them

Costs and risks become increasingly passed to local producers who must extract more from natural systems in order to survive

Similar effects can occur under different systems, but this economic system leads to widespread ecological change, generally degradation

Apolitical ecology tends to embrace malthusian and 'tragedy of the commons' explanations for deforestation in the Amazon

However these ignore the fact that the poor in the Amazon are responding to global economic pressures in the only way they can

However it is possible for the interaction with the environment to be positive, as was the case with banana plantations in the Caribbean

Development that pays sufficient attention to the knowledge and needs of locals and embraces equity/justice can avoid degradation

Degradation/Marginalization is not an independent theory per se, but a framework for understanding how systems interact



Chapter 8 Conservation and Control



Control of resources has been taken from locals whose practices have been historically environmentally benigh in favor of global interests

Conservation and preservation of the environment is not necessarily associated with improved outcomes for local people and social systems

Unfortunately efforts to preserve the environment in parks and preserves have often simply excluded local people dependent on them

Conservation emerges from Foucault's idea hegemonic governmentality, where government rule is self-imposed by people via institutions

Such institutions control social behaviors and the perception of what ecological outcomes are appropriate without considering locals

Strong state control is not absolutely necessary, merely acceptance of state goals by those with power in an area such as managers

Wilderness is an imposed ideal that is constructed, and typically excludes people from nature

Spatially bounded conservation territories are ineffective socially and environmentally as well

Conservation has historically been associated with coercive state control, which has sought to make locals internalize state norms

Social capital and cultural norms is inherent in traditional systems of management but is broken down by state level policy

External government constraints too often ignore local and essential information and portray local people as agents of degradation

The case of New England fisheries management, which emphasized ITQs, shows that privatization served to undermine sustainable systems

Privatization in fact promoted accumulation of capital by a few powerful companies, which forced locals out of business

Coercive state conservation institutions are not effectively challenged by simply granting concessions to locals as in buffer zones

Political ecology will be essential in identifying alternative models of conservation in the future that do not rely on state power



Chapter 9 Environmental Conflict


Scarcities that result from enclosure/seizure by powerful interests like states, firms, or elites exacerbate underlying social conflicts

Such conflicts are also exacerbated when one local goup takes control of collective resources and excludes others

Exclusion by a local group against other local groups can occur via leveraging state, firm, or elite backing

Such exacerbated conflicts represent a politicization of environmentally rooted conflict, and conflicts themselves can be ecologized

Social systems are organized to divide power and labor and structurally differentiate access to and responsibility for natural systems

Property rights are better understood as a complex bundle of rights and responsibilities that are controlled by politics and history

Historically, assumptions about class, race, and gender drive development in particular ways which leads to uneven results

Who is in control, who decides, and who is expected to perform what tasks are all vital political ecology questions in systems

Privatization of rights tends to undermine existing understandings of rights and responsibilities, re-framing rights to benefit holders

Many countries split access and use of land and resources along gender lines, which under pressure can lead to exploitative relationships

Aid initiatives directed towards women in some cases have been hijacked by men and used to increase gender inequities

Connections between humans and the environment are not limited to objects, but encompass rights, distributions, and division of labor

Environmental struggles are material in nature, but ideas and constructions can promote or prevent conflict

Equity and sustainability are not necessarily scale dependent, but dependent on specific arrangements between groups

Increased attention to poverty and women is not the same as attention to class and patriarchy

It is increasingly important to explain how and why conflict doesn't happen, as conflict is not inevitable in environmental systems

How groups are formed in ecological networks as well as how individuals respond and adapt are influenced by knowledge, process, politics

 

Chapter 10 Environmental Identity and Social Movement



Changes in environmental management have created opportunities/imperatives for local groups to secure political representation/power

Powerful global political and economic forces can be blunted by effective, cross-cutting social organization at a local level

Risks and hazards tend to be disproportionately placed on marginalized groups such as people of color in the US or women

Livelihood changes that are coupled with specific controls over development projects can yield different outcomes than might be expected

Subsistence living relied on systems of reciprocity that serve to reduce risk via moral expections with regard to shared burdens

Such reciprocal social systems can be adaptive and prevent collapse when the system is exposed to environmental or economic shocks

One key element of such systems with respect to political ecology is letting them express their claims and knowledge on their own terms

Externally imposed narratives, such as that in the Chipko movement in India, can obscure the actual causes in service of external goals

There is a danger in this aspect of political ecology in romanticizing local people, forming just a different narrative about them

Most political ecologists believe people should have self determination, control their own labor, build collective community institutions

Collective communities should be constructed to redistribute shared risk and maintain the dignity of all members of the community

Postcolonial studies must recognize that answers and actions that emerge from a local level are as valuable as those from academia

 

Chapter 11 Where to Now



There have been strong critiques of political ecology as being too political/normative or insufficiently tied to cohesive theory

 *P.206-207 lays out explicit theories of political ecology in condensed form

There is room for improvement, particularly in moving towards symmetrical explanations

PE should move away from degradation due to the term's politicization and construction, and towards the concept of production

Agents should move from being viewed as peasants to universal understanding of the important of producers

Shifting from the somewhat confusing idea of explanatory chains to networks could avoid issues of assuming hierarchy

Hybridity thesis: ecological characteristics and objects impinge on the human political world.

Hybridity thesis: However they also alter human systems and take on a new importance

Hybridity thesis: Networks form, which recently have been exploited by the powerful to build and maintain their own power

Hybridity thesis: Powers have explicitly sought to set the constructions of human/nature boundaries and control the network

Hybridity thesis: Victims of power have suffered unintended deleterious consequences, and resistance emerges from traditional networks
