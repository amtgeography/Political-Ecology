Chapter 1 - Introduction


Environmental problems such as soil erosion contain both physical and social components necessary for explanation
Reliance on technology to solve environmental problems is troublesome because poverty can prevent adoption of tech
Current practices in preventing soil erosion grew out of a colonial mindset, which was to an extent inherited by aid agencies
Assumptions with respect to how the political economy of the world functions are essential components of understanding problems



Chapter 2 - Is Soil Erosion Really a Problem?

It has been contested that soil erosion is a problem, arguments made for it stimulating technical progress or simply not existing
Presence of widespread soil erosion is logically identifiable, but proof in strict terms is difficult to obtain due to measurement costs
Ideology is a key determinant of whether or not soil erosion is identified as a problem at all, and what level is tolerable
Research agendas have typically been tied to the interests of large corporations or international powers, conservation to big NGOs
Individual pastoralists, to conserve or obtain technology to improve yields, must have capital, risk tolerance, access, umw
Resettlement programs have usually been expensive and rather ineffective, due to the traumatic effects of physically resettling
The social conditions surrounding soil erosion are very complex, generalizations must be relied upon, due to heterogeneous circumstances
Soil erosion occurs in peasant/pastoral, feudal, centrally planned, and advanced capitalist societies alike
The social relations of production under which land is used is a key and pervasive element in the explanation of soil erosion" P.37



Chapter 3 - A Review of Techniques and Policies

Techniques and policies are fundamentally different, the former being a method, possibly one of many, the latter is more of a program
Policy must ID geographic scope, determine decision authority, choose appropriate techniques, decide impleentation,distribute costs/benefits
Although failure is not universal, it is still observed that national conservation policies are quite prone to failure


Chapter 4 - Why Do Policies Usually Fail?

Most explanations of policy failure do not explicitly identify their ideological assumptions or are simply unaware of their own ideology
A social explanation of soil conservation failure can profitably begin by examining the how perceptions of the problem are formed
Different perceptions can lead to different ideas about who is responsible for soil erosion - backward peasants preventing success, eg
The neutrality of science is a common assumption that should be more closely examined, as accepting it restricts debate and assessment
It seems possible to identify a common syndrome of implicit assumptions that drive soil erosion explanations by policy initiatives
Identifying soil erosion as a purely environmental issue precludes attempts to understand social causes, may promote exclusion of people
Deciding that land users are the ultimately responsible parties via ignorance, laziness, umd promote education and possibly coercion
Overpopulation is a popular explanation for soil erosion emerging from Malthusian perspective, the solution is reducing pop. growth
Insufficient involvement in markets is another common explanation for soil erosion, implying that greater integration is necessary
Policies and assumptions from the colonial era have persisted past independence, partly due to economic integration in global economy
Foreign aid can exacerbate problems due to the narrow interests of donor countries and agencies, focus on metrics with limited local use
Common failure causes include misapplied research, low local applicability, unequal land distributions, participation, institutional weakness
Deep seated political-economic relationships of a particular sort are necessary for policies to succeed, a systems view is essential
Most conservation thinking assumes: soil erosion is local, the state is a neutral agent, land use is an economic activity



Chapter 5 - A New Approach - With New Problems

Soil erosion has many different causes that are socially, temporally, and spatially localized, making theory-building difficult
Social and natural sciences tend to operate in sufficiently different paradigms that integration is difficult
Even a seemingly local place-based explanation has spatial ties elsewhere, downstream for example, and different places may be comparable
Social factors are not always place based in the same sense as physical factors, as when state policy covers a large geographic region
A key starting point in developing theory is the household, the smallest economic unit of analysis, behavior moderated by political-economy
Social interrelationships inherently involve political assumptions, ideology, and analysis and not conducive to formal proof
The state is abstract, defined by sole legitimate use of force in an area, and is supposed to be reflective of the people'swill
The government is the hand of the state and its voice, and houses a bureaucracy as an essential element in its structure
Individuals within the bureaucracy have their own interests and social relationships, thus incentives at variance with the state/government
Simple institution building is not likely sufficient to promote conservation, as material incentives of many actors are affected by them
When physical phenomena like soil erosion affects people to the point they must adapt their mode of life a social phenomenon emerges
Political power of the classes affected by the physical/social phenomenon determines the response to it, with little power=little response
Systematic and widespread social/physical issues require some kind of political action, which will cause conflicts of interest to arise
The politically weak are less able to force their desired political solutions through, and may resort to resistance to secure their interests
To analyze, ask: what groups/classes are affected, what power does each have, how do they embrace ideology, is the problem enough for unity?
In developing countries the rural peasants have little power and are effectively ignored by the state apparatus, forcing adaptation measures
Urban elites may contrive prices for rural peasants that force them into marginal positions, pushing increased use of marginal lands to cope



Chapter 6 - Understanding Why Soil Erosion Occurs

*P.108-116, a diagram/model approach and explanation


Chapter 7 - The Exploitation of Natural Resources and Labor


Small farmers/pastoralists are connected to other classes via institutions of market, legal, conflict, development, umw
"Soil degradation and erosion directly result from cumulative land-use decisions through time" P.117
Soil erosion is also caused by the extraction of surpluses from land users
Surpluses in society are extracted at the level of the enterprise/place of production, and employers tend to accumulate these surpluses
Rents in kind and cash serve as other means of surplus appropriation flowing from peasants to landholders
Exchange is another major mechanism of soil erosion, with surpluses extracted by unfavorable terms of trade expressed by prices
"Exhaustion of land and labor go hand-in-hand as more labor time is required to work poorer, degraded, and more distant soils"
Colonial interests and capitalism have required appropriation of different resources from peasantry at different times in histor
Even post-colonialism the powerful interests present in the local area structured interactions with peasantry to continue appropriation
Internal bureaucratic struggles can also replicate the colonial/capitalist systems to ensure appropriation continue
Causal relationships arranged in a system diagram (example p.126) can delineate the interactions between key variables
Conservation policy can end up excluding the majority from the resources they need that are controlled by a minority power interest
'Tragedy of the Commons' argues privatization the remedy for commons degradation, but precursors to degradation are equally important
Marginalization of segments of society promote use of marginal,more fragile, lands, increasing degradation, at times because ofprivatization
Removal of nutrients can function as a form of degradation enhanced by a richer part of society purchasing manure/soil, umd
Steep slopes are often erosion sites, and enhanced use of steep slopes for production caused by historic power relations and marginalization



Chapter 8 - The Other Side of the Coin

"Small producers cause soil erosion because they are poor and desperate, and in turn soil erosion exacerbates that condition" P. 138
Larger producers may have the capital to promote conservation but may also themselves cause significant degradation
Timber extraction concessions can be one of the most important components of widespread environmental degradation in many developing nations
Many large companies engage in numerous practices that divert profits from local governments and degrade landscapes for corporate profits
They can also employ technological solutions to maximize profits, at times without worrying about long term land impacts
Hypothesis: only when degradation affects the accumulation of surplus will it be addressed, and this does not happen often
Capital owners will tend to use up natural resources if: they can obtain cheap land, obtain subsidized infrastructure, if lands are marginal, Capital owners will also tend to use up natural resources if: if they can invest elsewhere, or if political conditions are unsettled

Chapter 9 - What Now?

Soil erosion will not be confronted unless it materially impacts the accumulation interests of the dominant classes
Local land users end up being responsible proximately for soil erosion because they are forced to intensify their use of lands
Soil conservation policy rarely benefits the dominant interests in a society, and so it is difficult to foment movement on the problem
