1. Gender and Environment, Rocheleau et al


There are real differences, not just imagined differences, between how genders have access to and are responsible for environmental resources

These "derive from the social interpretation of biology and social constructs of gender, which vary by culture, class, race, and place"

Up to the point this book was written, PE scholars emphasized class and race, and did not adequately work with gender issues

Gender is, however, a critical variable shaping access, affecting livelihood strategies, and controlling sustainability viability

Gender is an axis of identity with material impacts, both in first and third world contexts

Common concerns fo women everywhere are survival, healthy environments, social responsibility for environmental protection, and rehabilitation desires

Science itself is gendered, with its categories and focal points being gender driven, with women often being seen as having local/traditional knowledge

Women are often taking on multiple roles, as producers, consumers, and those who reproduce, expected to deal with complex systems

Women are also often involved in commercial activities even though they may not be formal, and are often influenced by household roles

Health, ecology are important to everyday life and so are important to gender issues, as they are accessible to women

Formal science is reductionist, abstract, and quantified, and may be alienated from womens' experiences, whose bodies are almost seen as an environment

Resource access and environmental quality are strongly linked, power is also linked, to gender and what women are allowed to own and do

Certain resources are often gender-restricted, women often rely on common property, with rights nested alongside those of their men

Coded social responses may prevent women from accessing credit or owning property formally, even to use certain tools or crops

Environmental politics and activism at the grassroots level are also gendered, with women taking on specific roles, but often at core of activism

Women are often politically marginal and must use different strategies for engaging with political systems than men



2. Campbell, Connie & the Women's Group of Xapuri


Xapuri, Acre, is home to the rubber tappers led by Chico Mendes, and their grassroots movement is famous for its achievements

However, the contribution of women to the movement's success is often overlooked in situations save the protest actions themselves

In the heyday of the rubber extraction era women were shipped to the region by request of men, women still are only heads of household as widows

Women were integral to the movement at its inception, although their participation was tied in many cases to representing their manless household

Often women were illiterate, which had a material impact on their ability to negotiate contracts, draft formal materials

One of the major roles was to prevent conflict in physical actions to prevent loggers from operating - cultural mores against hurting women

Utilizing women in the front lines of conflict situations delayed violence, giving time for Mendes and other leaders to begin negotiations

Women began to play more of a role behind the scenes, although they were still relatively marginalized by Mendes and others

Slowly women began to be active union members, not merely used to bolster numbers, and began to try for leadership roles - though opposed



3. Feminist Politics and Environmental Justice, Miller et al.


African Americans have long fought against powerful interests in hopes of sustaining livelihoods, and women have had the added issue of gender to handle

Harlem has traditionally been a sort of dumping ground for projects other boroughs don't want, due to its historically being black

The North River Sewage Treatment Plant evoked significant opposition because of health concerns animated by Black Women, organizing via churches

The plant was built without promised equipment to reduce odors, hazardous fumes, and was yet another hazardous facility located in Harlem

Womens groups concerned about the community were a natural base from which to build a movement countering the hosting of hazardous sites in Harlem



4. Protecting the Environment Against State Policy in Austria, Wast-Walter


Austrian women had traditionally been politically marginalized, as were environmental concerns in the pro-development post WWII world

Proposed creaton of a hydroelectric power plant in an environmentally sensitive area stimulated resistance, primarily through women's actions

Thousands of people, led predominantly by women, walked into Hainburg forest to protest in the dead of winter to protest destruction

The movement eventually morphed in to developing a political bent, actively bringing women more fully into politics, building a Green Party



5. Spanish Women Against Industrial Waste, Josepa Bru-Bistuer


Women's concerns about health have havily affected their involvement in issues relating to environmental protection and fights against toxic waste

Perceptions of the environment are shown to be gendered, which in turn modify action involving women to mitigate environmental harms



6. Gendered Visions for Survival, Wangari et al


Rights of resource access, tenure, knowledge of resources, and politics are all gendered, and affected by neocolonial structures

In Mbeere, Kenya, women are predominantly responsible for agriculture, as young men tend to migrate to cities in search of wage jobs

Land registration schemes tend to exclude women's rights, with legacies of patrilineal control of rights and tendencies to legally recognize male claims

Farmers in general have difficulty obtaining credit, but women are even more burdened because of lack of collateral assets

Women have adopted strategies of group work, and are often held responsible for their immediate environments, allowing for use of various resources

In Machakos, Kenya, mwethya groups involve women collectively performing agricultural and soil conservation activities

This custom is longstanding but has changed in popularity based on different conditions, colonial conditions shifted to conscript labor for example

In modern days, poorer households have incentive to participate, improving access to assets, common property, and exchange networks

Soil conservation efforts are a major focus of these groups, who terrace extensively on common properties

Women are service providers via these groups for other community level infrastructure in need of repair, which is connecting women to political system

In Kathama, gendered knowledge affects responses to famine, with families led by women scavenging forested areas for subsistence foods

Knowedge of relevant practices in general were unevenly distributed among communities, often ignored by young, but women knew wild food and medicine

Male migration to urban areas gendered experiences of famine, pushing burdens onto women, even as men tended to actually own needed lands

In all areas women tend to involve themselves in collective action as an expression of their gender roles, access to/control over land essential



7. Development and Dismantling Social Capital, Shields, M. Dale


The Philippines see a situation where people are participating increasingly in market economy while also maintaining subsistence activities

Building social capital is integral in this area, with exchanges of resources, sometimes in form of gifts, playing an essential role

Closer integration in market economy affect control of resources, which affects the capability of families to sustain exchange mechanisms

There is a situation at times where people overuse environmental resources due to reluctance to reduce exchange mechanisms, while sustaining markets

Community sustainability, tied to community resilience to changes in environment, is tied to available resources - resource poor can lead to conflict

Communities tend to diversify due to seasonality of resource access and demand, as well as degradation of resource base in places

Labor is typically gendered, with women being expected to generate side income as well as bear reproductive responsibilities

Social capital tied to male networks has typically been priviliged, with middle and lower class households running into the most problems here

Importation of non-native hogs has been detrimental to women, as native hogs were better suited to climate, but imported hogs cost more to raise

Reliance on native hogs in some places has resulted in their persistence and the presevation of local knowledge relating to how to keep them healthy

Knowledge of successful hog raising has been utilized as part of exchange networks to allow women to build and sustain social capital

With male movement to wage paying activities, women have been left reliant on cash resources to hire labor to support their Nipa leaf activities

Typically, disadvantages are mediated via exchange networks as information/resources/labor can be shared among participants

In case of access to romblon materials for mat weaving, gendered power concerns cause women to keep quiet when resource destroyed by male-owned cattle

In case of fishing, dynamite use is detrimental to fish species, but sharing fish catch is integral to exchange networks, so dynamiting continues



8. "Our Lives Are No Different From That of our Buffaloes", Manjari Mehta


Loss of commons is endemic in Global South, with women suffering disproportionately due to loss of traditional access to key resources

Mountains are often the site of renewable environmental activities being particularly important, but market systems are penetrating mountain areas

Commercial activities including agriculture tend to have gender-specific benefits, with women being effectively excluded from processes

Result of changes have been changes in womens' labor value, control of decisions, loss of knowledge, access to male labor, general gender asymmetry

Sending boys to school, shift to commercial agriculture, male migration for wage labor, have all contributed to eroding gender role equity

Mountain/highland systems have been inadequately critiqued in terms of the effects changing circumstances are having on gendered systems

Because women tend to be seen as responsible for home food security, their loss of security/status has significant implications

Buffaloes, unlike cattle, are fed in stalls from product of womens' labor, their work is now more in demand, but unpaid

Prior to availablity of male labor migration, they effectively had to participate in household labor, assisting women

Small agricultural surpluses were common traditionally, and used for barter inside community - self-sufficiency was source of pride

Cash cropping has led to intensification, and soil fertility loss, has required labor intensification, replaced subsistence cropping

This has tied households to markets, including chemical inputs and credit systems, with success leading to cultural change marked by dowry costs

Increasing wealth in gross terms has only increased vulnerability due to the increased cost of inputs, causing insecurity

Gendered labor systems are tied to partiarchical system, men remain in control of land and resource allocation, women remain marginalized

Culturally, ideological tendency to restrict women to household has led to 'household' extent extending to surrounding area and family fields

Women end up being viewed as laborers whose capacity to expand their workload is effectively infinite, even as their knowledge is relied upon

Enclosure movement has reduced womens' access to common areas that are vital sources of fodder and fuelwood

Culturally significant activities for women are being culturally marginalized as males have access to other sources of income

Even as male migration for wage labor has led to absence, compensating push to multi-generation households has kept women marginalized by male relatives

Spaces are gendered as well, for example local markets are places of different behavior expectations for women relative to men

Men are culturally encouraged to utilize public institutions like gathering sites, shops, for social and political purposes - women are discouraged to

Significant cultural differences in expectations of gendered labor come down against female autonomy, ability to do business



9. Gendered Knowledge: Rights and Space in Two Zimbabwe Villages, Louise Fortmann

*primarily concerned with anecdotes and some data about how womens' knowledge differs from that of men, how to get around this in research



10. From Forest Gardens to Tree Farms, Rocheleau et al

* Mostly dealing with how male and female responsibility, control, and labor differ in Dominican Rep., males have control even when women provide labor

12. "Hysterical Housewives and Other Mad Women", Joni Seager

*Looking at the stereotypes applied to women in the US who bring up environmental contamination issues


13. Feminist Political Ecology, Thomas-Slayter et al


Feminist Political Ecology does not merely add gender as an important category, but emphasis analysis of identity and multiplicity and difference

Environment and society are linked, and being drawn into broader economic Systems with differential effects with respect to gender

The interconnection of all life is an essential component of FPE, and power relations must be understood, to assess environmental decision making

Ideology is inexorably tied to gendered access to information, technology, and resources, with a patriarchial model affecting womens' social value

Policy must address local contexts, the impact of global systems, and address both formal and informal institutions

Feminist concerns are converging across the globe, with women facing similar structures, but organizations continue to exhibit gender bias

Privatization and resultant impact on public spaces disproportionately affect women, even as they are excluded from public sphere in many cases

A balance between male and female rights is essential for ensuring equity and justice in society
