The idea of wildneress in Africa, as elsewhere (North America), has been socially constructed from a particular European aesthetic

Ties to the notion of Eden from the bible, the preferences of landed estate owners in Victorian England, both were applied to Africa

Typical in these conceptions is a human-less landscape full of animals and untouched, unmodified terrain, or humans in 'state of nature'

Where even allowed in this edenic paradise, locals are expected to fulfill particular role and use land in particular ways

This vision, enforced by colonial occupiers first then inheritor states after, has led to dispossession of locals

In Tanzania, Arusha game reserve was created by German colonialists, further enforced by English, later Tanzanian state to promote tourism

Meru communities alongside others occupied Arusha for at least two centuries prior to colonization, landscape was not 'untouched'

Pastoralism and small-scale agriculture practiced, land modified in support, game hunted, localities attained religious/culture importance

Early German colonists dispossessed Meru of productive lands historically used in common, served as sites for later game reserves

Europeans often used violence to take control of land, causing locals to flee, then claimed 'vacant' lands as lack of use = fair game

The material appropriation of African lands was followed by aesthetic appropriation in form of game reserves promoted by conservationsts

Conservationist goals in later years of animal population support actually were undermined by preserves which were too small to be effective

Too small to be effective for conservation, exclusionist policies on racial basis kept subsistence users from badly needed lands

Meru have attempted to use state institutions to contest exclusion, with some signs of success in recent years, some flexibility

Locals in particular need to use preserve lands for collection of fuel, for herding, and for trapping game to support subsistence

Exclusion from these lands coupled with unclear boundaries bring conflict between locals and wardens who can fine them for trespass

Philosophically, landscapes can be conceived in material terms of being 'for' production or consumption, reserves privilege the latter

Tied to landscapes of consumption, histories are re-imagined to conceive of a particular landscape in terms amenable to chosen narrative

So native occupation of Yellowstone and Yosemite are written out of narrative, as Meru are written out of Arusha, to allow edenic vision

Fauna preservation objectives end up not being adequately met because local knowledge and needs are ignored, ex: rhino no longer in Arusha

Meru locals are not unaware of importance of reserve, but have to square this with their material needs, unmet by tourist focus
