Chapter 1 - Peet and Watts

Political ecology works to understand relations between Nature and Society via analysis of social access to and control over resources

Environmental health and sustainable livelihoods are tied to political ecology through the nexus of resource access/control

Scale is a vital component, ranging from the body to the community to the state and beyond to the global - all 'imagined' scales

Green language is now pervasive, used by international NGOs, states, and social movements alike, demonstrating ubiquity and importance

Global environmental crisis, global demography, and global economic inequality are becoming/have become inexorably linked

New attention and growing bodies of discourse surrounding such issues offer an opportunity for a more robust political ecology

PE origins namewise reside in Cockburn (journo) Wolf (anthropologist) and Beakhurst (envi. sci) from the 1970s to connect env. with pol. econ

It was unique at the time in its attempt to integrate human and natural views of land degradation and accept diversity in conditions

PE itself grew out of three strands: systems theory, cultural evolution+materialism, and hazard/distaster literature in social science

Peasant studies and Marxism critiqued these foundations, challenged 'peaceful native' myths, focused on political economy connections

Difficulties in specifically defining PE at start due to contested definitions of key ideas like politics, economy, even ecology

Three assumptions: society and resources are mutually causal, chains of explanation link local to regional, structures frame action space

Marginalization, production pressures on resources, and pluralism in definitions/approaches create the PE conceptual 'toolkit'

Blaikie and Brookfield work is foundational, attacked neoclass. econ and marxist economic views, attacked 'population pressure on resources'

Weakness in early PE was over-focus on 3rd world poverty, when affluence/capital can clearly be responsible for degradation, and land

B and B invoke concepts in a very broad way, mitigating utility of PE as full theory - closest to this via surplus extraction concept/logic

1990s saw a new generation of PE grapple with critiques, controlling definitions, incorporating neighboring theoretical areas

Marxism contributed to PE by debating ecology in terms of labor and biological limits, state-control, linking nature and society

Actually treating the politics in political ecoloy also important, focusing on struggles for power between social groups locally and in state

Institutional focus also became more important, focusing on the existence and local management of common property resources

Understanding how discourse defines and privileges certain approaches also became key, certain approaches privileged in management vs others

Environmental history also received strong focus, looking at ecosystem change over the long term, and actual successes in areas

Finally ecology itself was unpacked and examined because early PE used an older, equilibrium based version that was largely discarded

Recent progress in PE has gone along two paths: knowledge/power/practice and justice/government/ecological democracy

Local communities have long practiced land management, but experienced differential knowledge within population, even history is constructed

Modernization emphasis in development literature is critiqued, where development is really rife with risk, uncertainty, contested discourse

Epistemic communities received larger focus due to differences in knowledge societies which still must often cooperate under uncertainty

Scientific hegemony is examined and critiqued in how it privileges certain scales and knowledge types (conclusions too) in social discourse

More attention is now focused on local democratic movements, resistance to state-imposed policy, and even the construction of the local

Community is key in PE, although it is constructed too, but still seen as important in knowledge, regulation, identity, institutions

Differential patterns in communities is still needed in PE, not all communities are alike, differentiated governance regimes needed

Local communities are intelligent, strategic actors too, they construct their plights to a degree, are not simply passive victims

Chapter 2 - Davis



The mid-late 19th century saw a series of severe droughts and famines stretching from North Africa through China, with 10s of millions dead

Existing explanations for the famine tend towards the malthusian, lamenting lack of technology, ignoring colonial effects

Massive grain exports in places like India took place, moving food to Europe even as people died alongside railroad lines

Induced trade deficits in China reduced local ability to cope as food was exported for cash, American colonial efforts used famine as tool

Nature sent a series of strong El Nino events that set the stage for abnormal, deleterious weather patterns like floods and droughts

Structural explanations strongly exacerbared El Nino effects, with three driving colonial impacts surpassing local adaptive capacity

Smallholder production was forced into global trade system exposing local producers to price fluctuations they could not handle

Terms of trade were systematically biased against smallholders in colonies, reducing their ability to generate an income at all

Imperalism undermined fiscal autonomy at the local level even where colonies were not on the ground, eliminating social welfare mechanisms

 



Chapter 3 - Hecht



In Mesoamerica, though in recent history massive deforestation was the norm, the doomed forest narrative deserves a rethink given new trends

Anthropogenic as well as successional forests are increasingly seen in the region as local institutions mediate globalization effects

Several theoretical strands attempt to explain deforestation: malthus/markets, property/politics, parks/reserves, technology, and movements

Why forests persist is another question, answered in 6 ways: isolation, livelihoods, institutions, Kuznets curve, transitions, and equity

Isolation claims that some forests are too far geographically from economic centers, and so aren't profitable to destroy

Livelihood believes that forest dwellers like rubber tappers rely on primary forests and that movements grow to protect forests

Institutions argues that via property regimes or politics rationalize forests, creating incentives for preservation/penalties for destruction

Kuznets curve models forest change in history, claims richer, developed societies value/can pay for forest preservation

Transition sees former forest users moving to the cities so that pressures to deforest areas are reduced in the rural areas

Equity examines the effects on the distribution of income in societies, with greater inequity leading to greater destruction

El Salvador has often been held as a quintessential model of deforestation, but this ignores dynamics of regrowth and management

Population densities have remained stable in many Salvadoran forests which now have less deforestation, which counters Malthus

Land redistribution has created a diverse situation on the ground, allowing land users to try various crops to meet changing markets

Even though agricultural prices have significantly declined access to productive resources has buffered local Salvadorans

Areas with greatest forest resurgence are also those that have been largely ignored by policy geared towards exports and urban development

Complexity needs to be embraced in forest studies because the mechanisms governing deforestation/recovery at local level are quite diverse





Chapter 4 - Zimmerer



Recent concern over soil erosion in Bolivia reflects ancient problems addressed by the Inca empire but largely ignored by colonial masters

The causes of soil erosion are not uniform across the country, giving rise to a variety of discourses addressing the issue

Institutions - government or non, peasants in their personal experience, and rural trade unions provide three dominant discourses

Following most PE, peasants have had to intensify due to uneven economic development, forcing them to avoid costly conservating methods

Discourses variably address three major factors: understanding of degradation, view of it as a problem, preceptions of viable solutions

They often tie strongly to the view of the problem, and do not develop in isolation: they interact with adjacent discourses

Institutions often blame peasants for land degradation, referring to cultural backwardness and emphasizing outreach/policy

Peasants themselves know of the loss and often blame themselves for erosion, but pointing out that it is forced on them

Even among peasants there are generational and educational differences in attributing erosion causes, older=superstition, younger=inequity

Trade unions seek to articulate the erosion problem alongside broader histories of subjugation and domination by elites





Chapter 5 - Kosek



A major conflict between environmentalists and locals, particularly Chicano foresters, emerged in 1990s New Mexico

There are disturbing connections between a racialized philosophy of nature in America's past and the movement's policy objectives

PE needs to recognize the importance of 'cultural politics of difference' where racial formations are inherently present in nature politics

America has long harbored an exclusionary mentality with respect to race, with whites being viewed as the only true Americans

A character was ascribed to Germanic bloodlines that became associated with being truly American, and this was tied to nature

Wild nature was seen as a character-building influence, particularly for American masculinity, and its preservation became important

Eugenics and the influx of immigrants in the 19th century collided, and the environmental roots of Muir, Leopold, umw were fixed in this time

Although they were not necessarily explicitly racist, they wrote in a time when this eugenicist racial environment was ubiquitous

Muir appreciate the US Army eviction of native Tenayas from Yosemite and their preventing Hispanic and native grazers from entering

The narratives of racial purity travel alongside those of the purity of nature and cultivating internal purity to a disturbing degree

Many of the original environmental writers unconsciously echoed later Nazi ideology, which also embraced nature as a purifying influence

Many of these writers also turned to explicit denunciations of mixed races and brown peoples as degenerate and less than the whites

In more modern years, noted environmental groups like the Sierra Club have invoked Hardin, Malthus, and others to fight immigration

It is in this context that modern brown land users and activists confront predominantly white environmentalists in New Mexico

The 'we' often invoked by environmentalists in the area does not seem to include Chicano rights activists and use of landscapes

The movement of predominantly rich whites into 'nature' either to live or play is constructed as good, even sustainable logging bad





Chapter 6 - Goldman



Foucault's notion of governmentality is increasingly important in understanding the effects of policy in local contexts

Governmentality sees government power as dispersed in the population which self-regulates in accordance with objectives of power

NGOs effectively promote governmentality in many of their activities, which try to get locals to act and think in a certain way





Chapter 7 - Neumann



National Parks have often been seen as harmless institutions that protect nature and natural heritage, but this is not held up by evidence

They were typically established through the dispossession and relocation of native peoples who had a long heritage in these lands

Parks erase the history of co-evolution between humans and landscapes, preserving not pristine nature but an artificial construction of man

The park model has been exported around the world under the auspices of protecting landscapes, but have in places similarly dispossessed

In many of these, particularly in Africa, the long history of pastoralist use and presence of tribes is written out of the narrative

Human occupation denied, no ecological justification for eviction, conservation enclosures linked to colonialism, enclosures hurt locals

The modern state coupled with emphases on sovereignty and development tends to portray rural people as backward and primitive

Areas inhabited by primitives lacking obvious markers of development (as perceived by state elite) seen as fair game for seizure

European colonial powers tended to call such areas lacking euro-style cultivation 'wasteland' and vulnerable to being claimed

State claims to sovereignty are a power statement justifying control and disposition of lands/resources within borders

Selous game reserve in Tanzania serves as an example of a state-defined 'reserve' that they sought to control despite native needs

The presence of the tsetse fly and accompanying sickness limited land livability but also served as an excuse to resettle native people

Need to maintain agricultural surplus for extraction to colonial center led to the destruction of numerous elephants

But the number of elephants continued to grow due to resettlement which kept locals and their livestock from controlling elephants

Wilderness was produced by power as part of control efforts, emptied of people to aid in control, legitimized by vision of 'wildness'





Chapter 8 - Dubash



The Washington Consensus backed state withdrawal from water institutions, leaving markets to organize, ignoring social aspects of water

Political ecology combats the notion of apolitical and self-regulating markets, seeing politics and institutions as critical and endemic

In Western India, it is lasting, embedded social institutions rather than markets that promote exchange of groundwater resources

World Bank, aided by states, have largely adopted view that major capital investment via private market is needed for water infrastructure

Expansion of markets into water provision is not necessarily bad, but unchecked and unregulated has potential for harm to poor people

Groundwater use in two western Indian villaages is tied to well ownership, with well owners able to use/sell as much water as they obtain

Aquifer decline has forced more expensive improvements beyond the means of all but wealthy individuals or coalitions

'Thick' markets where many transactions take place are tied to prior social institutions, land ownership, hydrology, kin/caste networks

One village has thick market, other sees price set according to custom and moral imperatve, this in the area with better infrastructure

Actual terms of payment for access to water vary according to village and season, tied to how well the owner can regulate buyer malfeasance

Markets in the area are clearly social institutions, not behaving according to neoclassical prescriptions, shaped by locality and ecology





Chapter 9 - O'Rourke



South China and Vietnam has both struggled to manage rapid industrialization and concomitant environmental degradation

Shift from socialist to market models with respect to environment could follow Kuznets curve, could cause new form of state-market synthesis

Worker and community resistance to degradation threatening livelihoods are seen increasing, though following 'accepted' paths in locality

States are sites of contestation between interests of citizens and need for economic growth, which can be faster via environment abuse

South Vhina and Vietnam have seen extremely fast economic growth in recent years, coupled with terrible degradation of air and water

Civil society is not officially sanctioned, but becoming more common informally, with collective action supportedby existing institutions

Churches, village relations, family and kin networks, even state controlled institutions all serve as sites for collective action

Although state has sought to use party to control all, it has also been sensitive to perceptions of not serving the needs of masses

Firms now often have state support and state does little to control pollution, but need to appease population leads to some attention

Community and local firms have been observed to negotiate for pollution control, with careful moves and appeals to state law/policy

Significant incidents can galvanize public support, particularly when co-occurring in highly visible way with local symbol, like celebration

Even through decades of central planning under communist government, local autonomy has survived and can work to mitigate impacts





Chapter 10 - Watts



The Niger delta is now a site of significant violence due to the exploitation of oil resources in the area by state and corporations

Oil spills, gas flaring, illegal storage, land dispossession, state repression have resulted in violent resistance by local groups

The conception of 'resource curse' is dangerously close to expressing a view of commodity determinism that absolves guilty parties

However, the exploitation of oil and people near it is due to choices of oil companies, state representatives, seeking control over land

State statutory authority over resource, distribution of revenues to states, and alliance with corporations characterize oil complex

Inability of chiefs to exercise traditional authority has enabled culture of youth vigilantism, undermining prior governmentality in area





Chapter 11 - Schroeder & Suryanata



Agroforestry systems have been viewed by as essentially good, capable of mixing uses on lands in socially and ecologically beneficial ways

However, there is potential for their abuse given differential power relationships between groups in society, including those based on gender

Ecological benefits may mask issues of power, including dispossession and changes based in disparate gender roles in a given society

In Gambia, for example, women have traditionally been restricted to certain economic activities, particularly horticulture

Agroforestry initiatives have the potential to change material incentives, allowing male encroachment on lucrative female-dominated activity

In Java, males captured female labor as part of caretaking agricultural initiatives, due to contested visions of agroforestry's social place





Chapter 12 - Carney



Gender issues are important to recognize as they are increasingly key to development in rural areas via household material relations

Male heads of their households tend, in Gambia, to use landholding concentration to capture surplus female labor, causing conflict

Women have historically and culturally been provided access to particular lands and resources, for example wetlands

Women were typically involved in subsistence agriculture, growing rice for household consumption, while men engaged in commodity production

Changing relations of production associated with global market integration increase incentive for female labor to be expropriated

The designation of land as 'Maruo' was strategically used as an enclosure technique against women's contemporary accepted rights
